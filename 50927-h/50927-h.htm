<p class="caption h">STAR HACK SAW.
No. 2.</p></div>

<p>This Saw is much harder than a file, and will cut iron almost as fast
as it will wood. One saw blade will cut off a bar of half&#8208;inch round
iron one hundred times. The blade is eight inches long, and will do
most of the sawing required about a house, shop, or farm. The Patent
Frame is made of steel, polished and nickel plated. It will face the
saw in four directions, as desired. Frame and twelve Saw Blades sent
by mail, postage prepaid, on receipt of &#36;1.50. Hardware dealers will
furnish them at the same price. All genuine goods are marked with a
star and bear our name. We also have full control of the Star Bracket
Saws, and warrant them to be better than any imported blades.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SHAKESPEARE_MEMORIAL_AT_STRATFORD_UPON_AVON">THE SHAKESPEARE MEMORIAL AT STRATFORD&#8208;UPON&#8208;AVON.</h3>

<p>The American veneration for the birthplace of Shakespeare is well
known, and it has just taken practical shape by the presentation to
the town of a public drinking fountain and clock tower, the gift
of an American citizen, Mr. George W. Childs, of Philadelphia, in
commemoration of the jubilee of Queen Victoria. The memorial has
been erected in Rother Street, a broad open space near the center of
the town, where several thoroughfares converge, and where the annual
statute fairs or &#8220;mops&#8221;  take place. The structure is handsome and
imposing, and is built of Peterhead granite &#40;for the fountain&#41; and
of hard freestone &#40;for the clock tower&#41;. The base of the tower is
square, with projecting buttresses at the four corners, terminating
in acutely pointed gablets, surmounted by a lion bearing the arms of
Great Britain alternately with the American eagle and the stars and
stripes. Appropriate inscriptions are engraved on the four sides of
the memorial. The tower terminates in a spire, beneath and surrounding
which are smaller spires and turrets. The whole height of the structure
is fifty feet. The architect is Mr. Jethro A. Cossins, of Birmingham.
The ceremony of inaugurating the fountain was performed on Monday,
October 17, by Mr. Henry Irving, in the presence of the Mayor &#40;Sir
Arthur Hodgson, K.C.M.G.&#41;, the corporation, and a distinguished
company of visitors. Sympathetic letters were read from Mr. J. Russell
Lowell and Mr. Whittier; and speeches were delivered by Mr. Irving,
by Mr. Phelps, the American Minister, Mr. Walter, of the <i>Times</i>, Sir
Theodore Martin, and others.&mdash;<i>London Graphic</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Optical_Refinements_in_Architecture"><span class="small">Optical Refinements in Architecture.</span></h3>

<p>Many architects look upon all refinements of line and curve as so much
waste time, and would as soon think of referring to the original Latin
of Vitruvius for rules in proportioning their rooms as to consult and
apply the corrections of the Parthenon to their buildings. In sketching
out his design to a small scale on a sheet of Whatman&#8217;s drawing paper,
the architect does so without any further thought than to produce
a convenient plan or a well grouped elevation. Any infinitesimal
correction to the straight line or entasis would be inappreciable to
the naked eye on the surface of paper the inequalities of which would
render it worthless; nor does he take much trouble in the proportions
of his rooms, so long as they look right and fit well. If such
refinements are to be made, they should be shown in large drawings,
or set out to the full size on the works by proper rules and other
instruments. The task is laborious and troublesome, and contract prices
are little in sympathy with such niceties of adjustment. Even of the
more practicable mode of adopting certain ratios and proportions, the
architect does not avail himself very much.</p>

<p>We do not say that every horizontal beam&mdash;such as an entablature
supported by columns at intervals&mdash;ought to be &#8220;corrected&#8221; by the
application of a parabolic curve, or that every string course and
cornice should be arranged to curve or bend upward; but we contend that
these refinements ought to be made in interiors wherever the lines
are long, and contrasting lines and surfaces occur in juxtaposition;
that they are, in truth, applying precisely the same principle of
correction as the colorist or decorator would apply when he takes care
to juxtapose two colors or shades which shall be complementary to or
harmonize with each other.</p>

<p>It is painful to witness in modern buildings a perfect ignoring of
these principles of design. We go into a public hall or concert room,
and take our seat. The flat coffered ceiling appears to be literally
bending or falling upon our heads. To make the impression still more
apparent, the architect has introduced a circular or flatly curved arch
over the orchestral recess. If the ceiling is a flat curve, as it often
is, the trusses are, perhaps, brought down below and incased, their
lower edges being made perfectly horizontal, the two lines serving
to increase the difference between them; in other words, to make the
trusses look as if they were deflecting.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennethorne, some years ago, showed that the masses of the temples
of Athens and Rome were designed on perspective principles&mdash;that is
to say, the masses and many of the details were designed as they
were intended to be viewed. The point of sight was always before the
architect&mdash;that is to say, he studied the effect of his entablatures,
abaci, and other masses of details from points of view that were
likely to be frequented. It is well known that the various sections
through the Doric capitals, the mouldings, and other parts of Athenian
buildings, were composed of different arcs of the conic sections.
Mr. Pennethorne says that the Greek entablature is perspectively
proportioned and arranged to suit the given points of sight thus: The
apparent height of entablature is measured in seconds upon the arc of
a great circle. &#8220;Then, dividing this whole apparent height into some
given number of aliquot parts, measured also in seconds, the apparent
height of the architrave, of the frieze, and cornice will, in each
case, be a multiple of this given modulus. Again, by dividing the first
modulus into a given number of apparent aliquot parts, a second modulus
is obtained, by which the apparent heights of all the details of the
cornice of architrave and frieze will be regulated, and the true lineal
heights are then all determined by trigonometrical calculations.&#8221; In
short, all the visible heights of features are, upon this principle,
regulated from a given point, the real elevational height of each part
being afterward found.</p>

<p>This system of proportion would probably entail too much labor upon
the architect to work out with any accuracy, and may be looked upon as
chimerical. But we see instances every day of positive ignorance of
these principles, especially in the designing of mouldings, projecting
features, and towers. If the architect is too impatient to make nice
corrections in the manner we have pointed out, he ought at least to
take the trouble necessary to regulate his heights and masses before
inking in his elevations. Sketching in perspective is a valuable
auxiliary in designing roughly the masses of a building; but some more
accurate method is required in perspectively setting out the heights of
stories, entablatures, parapets, towers, and other features. This can
only be done by adjusting all heights from a given point of sight, or
upon the arc of a circle described from the said point. An elevation is
misleading, as every architect knows who has suffered disappointment
after the building is finished. It only gives vertical heights, which
may be very much curtailed or foreshortened in the actual view of the
building from the opposite side of the street, for example.</p>

<p>Many towers and spires have been spoiled by designing them in elevation
instead of at the angle. In broach spires we find a want of care in
one particular above the others. The broach is designed on the level.
The hips of the broach are made to look gentle in elevation, but when
raised above the eye 60 or 100 feet, they become so depressed as to
give a very ungraceful and abrupt springing to the spire.</p>

<p>We may instance the want of entasis to spires and columns. Every one
who has a critical sense of vision must have observed the apparent
weakness there is in a spire that has perfectly straight sides, when
compared with one which has been entasised, and the same with all
columns. Here also the method to insure the correction can be easily
applied. The more important of these refinements are capable of being
made at the initial stage of design, without recourse to decimals
of two or three removes from the decimal point, or to mathematical
calculations.&mdash;<i>Abstract from the Building News</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Testing_Pile_Protecting_Compounds"><span class="small">Testing Pile&#8208;Protecting Compounds.</span></h3>

<p>In 1882 several piles, coated with various patent anti&#8208;teredo
coverings, were driven in the harbor of San Francisco for the purpose
of testing them. Recently Engineer Manson began pulling up the piles in
order to see the result of the experiments. A pile coated with Pearce&#8217;s
compound, composed of paraffine, limestone, kaolin, etc., was found
to be completely honeycombed by the teredos. The eucalyptus and cedar
piles were also nearly destroyed. In 1884 the two piles incased by A.
W. Von Schmidt in sewer pipe and cement, the twenty&#8208;three coated by
Frank Shay with asphalt and wire cloth, the ten of McKeon &amp; Co., coated
with warm cement containing a poisonous substance, and those of W. H.
Hayes, coated with Portland cement, etc., were examined by Colonel
Mendel and Mr. Manson. All showed signs of having proved failures. The
insect is ahead of the inventors up to date.</p>

<h3 id="A_Tower_on_the_Mount_of_Olives">A Tower on the Mount of Olives.</h3>

<p>The tower which is being erected by the Russians on the highest point
of the Mount of Olives is already several stories high, but one
more is to be added. The object is to make it so high that both the
Mediterranean and the Dead Sea may be seen from the top. A number of
bells will be placed in the tower. In digging the foundation, several
Christian graves were found, together with an inscription in Greek, in
which the word &#8220;Stephanus&#8221; could yet be deciphered.</p>

<h3 id="TO_OUR_READERS_AND_PATRONS">TO OUR READERS AND PATRONS.</h3>

<p>The present number closes our fourth volume and brings us to the end of
another year. Many subscriptions now terminate, and we ask our patrons
to be prompt in sending their renewals, thus avoiding the loss of any
numbers. The terms are only &#36;2.50 a year.</p>

<p>Considering the wealth of illustration, the variety and value of
information presented, this work is by far the cheapest of anything in
the same line.</p>

<p>To builders, and those contemplating the erection of dwellings or other
structures, our paper has proved to be of great value.</p>

<p>With every number, during the past two years, we have given plates
in colors of many new buildings, with specifications, accompanied by
extra special sheets of details. In most cases these have been so
complete as to enable the builder and contractor to proceed at once
with the construction; and on the plans thus presented, thousands of
new buildings have been erected in all parts of the country. In almost
every town in the land attractive dwellings are now to be seen, which,
on inquiry, will be found to have been built from <span class="smcap">Scientific
American</span> plans.</p>

<p>No architectural publication in the world presents to its patrons
so many practical specifications and drawings without cost, except
the merely nominal subscription rate of &#36;2.50 a year. It is hardly
necessary to remind the builder that he would be obliged to pay several
hundred dollars if the same number of plans were to be specially
prepared for him.</p>

<p>In addition to the colored plates, details, and specifications, we have
furnished a large number of other new architectural illustrations and
many pages of valuable information. In all, the past year&#8217;s volumes
include about one thousand engravings.</p>

<p>We remind our readers of these items with the hope they will mention
them to their friends, and, if possible to secure a new subscription,
to send it in with the renewal of their own.</p>

<p>Our aim is to improve and enlarge the sphere of work, rendering it more
and more valuable. To this end we need the support and encouragement of
as many subscribers as possible. If each one of our friends will do a
little for us in this direction, all the parties concerned will derive
benefit.</p>

<p>If any of readers have inquiries to be answered, or suggestions to
make, relating to subjects or features they would like to see treated
in our paper, we shall, at all times, be pleased to hear from them.</p>

<h3 id="A_FRENCH_COTTAGE">A FRENCH COTTAGE.</h3>

<p>We publish herewith the plans for a house designed by M. A. Fatalot
and erected by M. Valette, architect. It is built on the side of the
terrace &#40;Rue Babie&#41;, on the green hills which overlook the Seine.</p>

<p>The construction is very simple. The architect was, in fact, asked
to use the strictest economy. The first floor, built over a cellar,
consists simply of a vestibule, A, which opens into a dining room, C,
a bed room, D, a kitchen, B, the water closets, E, and the stairway.
The latter is constructed of wood and leads to the second story, which
serves as both studio and drawing room. This room is lighted by the
large window shown in our perspective view. The walls of the building
are of stone&mdash;stone from Meudon, nicely colored&mdash;and Bourgogne bricks
of different shades form the design of the frieze. The basement is of
dressed stone; the pediments of the gables and the cornice are covered
with a plaster of sand and mortar colored in imitation of stone. The
tops of the pediments are decorated with Parvillee faience. The perron
is of Bagneux stone and the mullions and supports of Euville stone.</p>

<h3 id="Our_Forestry_Problem"><span class="small">Our Forestry Problem.</span></h3>

<p>According to latest estimates, we consume yearly, with our present
population of sixty millions, not less than twenty billion cubic feet
of wood. The amount is made up, in round figures, in the following
manner:</p>

<p>2,500,000,000 feet for lumber market and wood manufactures;</p>

<p>360,000,000 feet for railroad construction;</p>

<p>250,000,000 feet for charcoal;</p>

<p>500,000,000 feet for fence material, etc.;</p>

<p>17,500,000,000 feet for fuel.</p>

<p>To this it will be safe to add, for wasteful practices and for the
destruction by yearly conflagrations, at the least, twenty&#8208;five per
cent.</p>

<p>The average yearly growth of wood per acre in the well stocked and well
cared for forests of Germany has been computed at fifty cubic feet.
Applying this figure to our present requirements, we should have an
area of not less than five hundred million acres in well stocked forest
to give us a continual supply of all kinds for our present needs. Now,
a careful canvass made four years ago developed the result that the
existing forest area in the United States, excluding Alaska and Indian
Territory, comprised almost five hundred million acres &#40;489,280,000&#41;;
but it is well known to everybody who is acquainted with our forests
that they cannot compare in yield with the average European Continental
forests under systematic management. Much of what is reported as forest
is useless brush land or open woods, and depreciated in its capacity
for wood production by annual fires, by which the physical structure of
the leaf mould is destroyed, and thus, too, its capacity for storing
the needful moisture, reducing wood production, and killing all young
growth.</p>

<p>Without care, without management, and left to the kind but uneconomical
work of nature, interfered with, in addition, by rude and ignorant
action of man, it is doubtful whether, on the existing area, one
half the amount of wood is produced yearly which we now require. We
have, therefore; beyond doubt, reached&mdash;if not passed&mdash;the time when
increased drain means squandering of capital, and when regard to
husbanding, to careful management, to recuperation of our forests,
and planting of new forests is required for the purpose of merely
furnishing raw material; and it should not be forgotten that to
reproduce the quick growing white pine of an acceptable quality and
sufficient size requires not less than eighty to one hundred years,
and for the long leaved pine two hundred years; that, altogether, wood
crops are slow crops; that nothing of size can be grown under a quarter
of a century at the best.</p>

<p>That this is a business requiring intelligent national consideration
is apparent. Not less so if we appreciate the magnitude of the values
resulting from it. The total value of forest products in the census
year was placed at &#36;700,000,000, or ten times the value of the gold
and silver production, five times the value of all coal and mineral
production, and exceeding every one of the agricultural crops, corn and
wheat not excepted; and representing in value about thirty per cent. of
the total agricultural production.</p>

<p>Of injuries wrought locally by the reckless clearing of hill sides and
of deterioration of the soil due to inconsiderate action of man, I
could entertain you by the hour. The country is full of examples. Any
one who wishes to study the effect of such denuding of hill sides upon
the soil, the water flow, and agricultural conditions, need not go to
France, Spain, Italy, Greece, or Palestine. The Adirondack Mountains
are within easier reach, where the thin cover of earth exposed to
the washing rains is carried into the rivers, leaving behind a bare,
forbidding rock and desolation, while at Albany the Hudson River is
being made unnavigable by the <i>debris</i> and soil carried down the river.
The government has spent more than ten million dollars, I believe, and
spends every year a goodly sum, to open out a passage over the sand bar
thus formed.</p>

<p>Go to the eastern Rocky Mountains, or to Southern California, and you
can gain an insight into the significance of regulated water supply for
the agriculture below, and also learn how imprudently we have acted
and are acting upon the knowledge of this significance by allowing the
destruction of mountain forests in the most reckless and unprofitable
manner. Along the shores of Lake Michigan, and along the sea coast, we
are creating shifting sands by the removal of the forest cover, to make
work for the ingenuity of our children in devising methods for fixing
these sands again. The vegetable mould with which the kind forest had
covered the alluvial sands of the southern coast plain we are taking
pains to burn off in order to replace it with expensive artificial
fertilizers.</p>

<p>That the great flood of the Ohio, which cost the country more than
twenty million dollars, was entirely due to deforestation, I will
not assert; but it must have been considerably aggravated by the
accumulation of minor local floods, due to the well known reckless
clearing of the hill sides, which sent their waters down into the river
in torrents. At the season when the winter snows are melting, watch the
newspapers, and you will find an almost daily mention of the disastrous
ravages of brooks and streams, many of which injuries could have been
prevented by avoiding the creation of their distant and indirect cause.
Thus we may multiply examples all over the country, showing harmful
local influences upon agricultural conditions due to forest devastation.</p>

<p>That the vast stretches of land in the Northwest, from which the white
pine has been cut and burned off, present the aspect of a desolation
which sickens the heart, you may hear from every one who has seen these
deserts unnecessarily wrought by man. Every traveler in this country,
be it to the White Mountains, to the Adirondacks, along the Alleghany
Mountains, be it through the Rockies or the redwoods of California,
cannot but be startled by the desolate, sad aspect of many of these
once beautifully clad mountain crests.</p>

<p>And we are a nation hardly a hundred years old, with over thirty acres
per capita to spread ourselves upon. What will become of us when we
must live upon five acres per head? We are far enough advanced in our
recklessness of disregarding the indirect significance of forest areas
to have learned a lesson at home, and to feel the necessity of being
more careful in the utilization of the forest, so as not to lose its
protection for our agricultural and general interests.</p>

<p>The means for its solution I may only briefly indicate. They are
education, example, encouragement, legislation. Some of these are
of slow effect. Others can be made to give results at once. Let the
United States government, which still holds some seventy million acres
of the people&#8217;s land in forests, mostly on the Western mountains,
where its preservation is most urgently needed&mdash;let the government
set aside these otherwise valueless lands, and manage them as a
national forest domain, and then the first effective step, a feasible
and not a forcible one, is made. Let the military reservations on
the Western treeless plains, which are still in the hands of the
general government, be planted to forests and managed as such. This
would be no doubtful experiment, would interfere with nobody, would
enhance the value of the surrounding country&mdash;and education, example,
and encouragement are provided, as far as it is in the legitimate
province of the general government. And such example, instead of
costing anything to the country, can be made self&#8208;sustaining&mdash;nay,
productive&mdash;and would add appreciably to the people&#8217;s wealth.&mdash;<i>B. E.

<h3 id="Bamboo_Tree"><span class="small">Bamboo Tree.</span></h3>

<p>Writing from China, a correspondent says that the Chinese have
developed the culture of the bamboo tree very wonderfully. They can
produce a perfectly black as well as a yellow bamboo. The Emperor of
China has one officer whose duty is to look after his bamboo gardens.
This valuable tree is found in all tropical and sub&#8208;tropical regions,
both in the eastern and western hemispheres. An attempt has been made
in England, and with some success, to raise a dwarf species found at
an altitude of 12,000 feet in the Himalaya mountains. The new world
furnishes bamboo of the greatest diameter. The stems are usually very
slender, but in the northwestern part of South America is found one
species with a diameter of 16 inches. The Chinese put this plant to a
greater variety of uses than any other people. Some kinds of it when
it first shoots up from the ground are used as a vegetable as we use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>asparagus, or it can be pickled in vinegar or made into delicious
sweetmeats. The plant has to be 30 years old to blossom, and then it
bears a great profusion of seeds and dyes. These seeds may be used like
rice, and a kind of beer may be made from them. In 1812 severe famine
in portions of China was prevented by the sudden blossoming of a great
number of bamboo trees. The stems of all the varieties are remarkably
silicious. One kind found in Java is so hard that it strikes fire
when the hatchet is applied to it. This has only a very slender stem,
which is polished and used as stems for tobacco pipes. This Protean
tree furnishes material for houses, boats, cordage, sails of boats,
telescopes, aqueduct pipes, water&#8208;proof thatching, clothing, water
wheels, fences, chairs, tables, book cases, boxes, hats, umbrellas,
shields, spears, and paper. The pith is used for lamp wicks, so there
is no part of it that cannot be used for something. From some of it
exquisite carvings inlaid with gold and silver are cut, that exceed
in beauty the ivory carvings for which the Chinese are so famed.
Recently it has been put to another use. Mr. Edison has found that
the carbonized fibers of the bamboo furnish the best material for the
incandescent electric lamp, and has made use of it in his system of
lighting. In Burmah and Siam whole cities are built from bamboo. These
houses are made in pieces, lashed together, and raised on posts several
feet high.&mdash;<i>The Lumber World</i>.</p>

<h3 id="FIREPROOF_STRUCTURES"><span class="small">FIREPROOF STRUCTURES.</span></h3>

<p>An article recently published by us apropos of the Opera Comique
catastrophe has brought us several interesting communications, and,
among them, one from Mr. Hennebique, one of the designers of the 948
foot Belgian tower. Mr. Hennebique has established the fact that
structures in which iron is used in the flooring do not arrest the
ravages of fire, but fall even more quickly than those in which wood is
employed.</p>

<p>In fact, the beams that support the ceiling joists, flooring,
and laths, naturally combustible materials, are raised to a high
temperature, and, becoming red hot, bend under their own weight, and at
the same time shove the walls outwardly.</p>

<p>The flooring of Mr. Hennebique&#8217;s invention, which is composed of a
cement made of coal ashes, plaster rubbish, and hydraulic lime, is
refractory enough to resist the heat developed by combustion.</p>

<p>As may be seen from the figure, this flooring consists of tubular
girders resting upon very simple metallic anchorages. These girders
are of the composition above described, and thus constitute a sort
of monolith upon which any sort of a floor can be laid&mdash;terra cotta,
marble, wood, etc.</p>

<p>Aside from its being nearly completely incombustible, this sort of
flooring presents a great advantage, from an economical standpoint, in
consequence of the rational utilization of the materials employed. It
is unnecessary to say that the metal is perfectly protected against
oxidation.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this flooring is that it almost entirely prevents
the propagation of sound.</p>

<p class="caption">HENNEBIQUE&#8217;S FIREPROOF FLOORING.</p></div>

<p>As may be readily seen, this mode of construction is applicable to
different uses and to every possible sort of decoration, such as
cornices, compartment ceilings, girders of various styles, as well as
pillars, pilasters, columns, and supports of every shape and every
resistance.&mdash;<i>Chronique Industrielle</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Construction_of_Chimney_Flues"><span class="small">Construction of Chimney Flues.</span></h3>

<p>In a letter to the <i>Insurance World</i> Mr. Thomas Boyd, architect, of
Pittsburg, Pa., gives the following practical information:</p>

<p>I have had considerable experience in examining buildings burned by
fire, having been associated with my father for eleven years, and
during that time have examined hundreds of buildings destroyed by fire.
I have traced more fires to the cause of defective flues than to any
other source, and I could refer you to buildings, not only in this
city but in others, where fires have occurred from this cause, and the
insurance men and the public in general stated that the fire occurred
from &#8220;unknown causes,&#8221; as it was first seen many feet away from the
flues.</p>

<p>In seventy&#8208;five cases in one hundred where fires occur from &#8220;unknown
causes,&#8221; it can be traced to defective brickwork. Ordinarily, an
architect specifies that the brickwork shall be well slushed, and that
the flues shall be well pargeted or plastered on the inside. This is
a great error, as no flues should be plastered on the inside, and no
walls having flues in them should be slushed, as the term is generally
understood.</p>

<p>The flues should in all cases be built smooth on the inside, and all
the joints should be filled full of mortar, the vertical joints as
well as the bed joints. The lining of the flue or the four inches
surrounding the flue should always be kept in advance of the brickwork,
and the brick adjoining the lining and the second and third brick, and
so on, should be shoved in soft mortar up against each other. This will
fill all the vertical joints from bottom to top as laid. The slushing
that is ordinarily put in from the top only goes down into the joint
about ½ inch, thus leaving an opening the entire length of the wall,
and in some cases an opening which a mouse could crawl through. As it
is only a question of time when all the plastering that can be put on
the inside of a flue will fall off, it will leave these vertical joints
between the bricks open into the flue, and as the joists cross through
these joints in the brickwork, fire is liable to take place ten or
twenty feet away from the flue. I have taken down many old buildings in
which these joints were filled with carbon or soot.</p>

<p>If the flues are built as above described, any competent builder
or architect can find out whether the mechanics doing the work are
slighting it or not; but if the inside of the flue is plastered or
lined with terra cotta or any other material, you cannot tell whether
the wall is properly built or not until this plastering falls off,
which it will in the course of a few years. Thus all buildings erected
with plastered flues are liable to burn at any time.</p>

<p>I have made a practice for a number of years of building flues without
lining them, and then when the house is built, or as each story is
erected, I put a dense smoke in the flue and close the opening at the
top. If there is a hole the size of an ordinary pin head, the smoke
will find it and penetrate into the interior of the wall adjoining the
flue.</p>

<h3 id="Roadside_Plantations_of_Trees_in_Belgium"><span class="small">Roadside Plantations of Trees in Belgium.</span></h3>

<p>The roadside planting of trees is carried out on a most extensive
scale in Belgium, forming a marked feature in the landscape of that
country. According to the report of M. J. Houba, State Head Bailiff
or Ranger of Woods and Rivers in Belgium, recently published in the
<i>Revue Horticole</i>, the total length of the highroads of Belgium in 1881
amounted to 4,227 miles, classified, as regards tree planting, in the
following manner:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="myleft" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="belgian trees">
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th><th class="tdr">Miles.</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roads already planted</td><td class="tdr">2,417</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8222;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still to be planted</td><td class="tdr">264</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8222;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cannot be planted&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">1,546</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr bord_top_yes">4,227</td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>From this it will appear that, at the date mentioned, more than half
the entire length of the Belgian highroads had been planted, and that
the proportion would soon reach two&#8208;thirds.</p>

<p>The number of trees used in forming these plantations amounted
to 871,685, representing in 1881 a money value of &pound;415,986, the
average cost of each tree when planted having been about 2s. 6d. The
plantations had therefore at this date increased in value to nearly
four times the amount of the capital originally expended upon them.</p>

<p>The trees principally employed in these roadside plantations &#40;already
made&#41; are: Elms, 371,621; oaks, 130,828; poplars, 80,853; ash,
73,893; beech, 32,970; maples, 27,755; service trees, 24,630; Norway
spruce, 43,767; larch, 41,699. It will be seen from this list that
coniferous trees are largely used in Belgium for roadside planting. On
the other hand, the report only gives 897 plane trees, 976 acacias,
and 672 cherry trees, apple trees, and pear trees, showing that
while the Belgian authorities fully recognize the great utility of
these roadside plantations in other respects, they especially aim
at the production of timber of good quality in a commercial point of
view.&mdash;<i>The Garden</i>.</p>

<h3 id="An_Egyptian_Temple"><span class="small">An Egyptian Temple.</span></h3>

<p>An Egyptian temple appears to have been one of the most imposing
assemblages of buildings that can be well conceived. Avenues lined
with hundreds of sphinxes on each side led the worshiper to the
sacred precinct for the distance of thousands of feet, and thus the
mind, even when remote from the vicinity of the temple, received an
impression calculated to excite veneration. This avenue was terminated
by a stupendous mass of pyramidal form, above 200 feet wide and about
80 feet high, whose enormous proportion was naught diminished by the
vastness of the plain in which it stands, nor by contrast with the
mountains that overhung it. In the center of this propyleum is a door,
flanked in advance by an obelisk on each side, about 90 feet high,
and beside which are figures of colossal dimensions, 45 feet high,
sitting as guardians of the sacred portal. The effect of the whole
is gigantic, and calculated to impress the coming worshiper with the
fullest notions of his insignificance in the scale of material nature.
The triumphal gateway being passed, a magnificent court meets the eyes
of the beholder, having on each side a colonnade. And this court led
to a densely columned hall or vestibule, under the shades of which
the crowds of Egypt&#8217;s sons and daughters reposed to recover from the
exhaustion and fatigue caused by their journey under a burning sun to
the fane of their creature god. And here the mind also dwelt awhile on
the first impressions produced by the contemplation of the overpowering
majesty of the gorgeous mass. For the huge propylea, which inclosed
either end of the court, and the hall, with its forest of clustered
columns, which the eye could not number, and the playful variety
and copiousness of channeled hieroglyphics which left not a space
uncovered, and the brilliancy of the pigment which gave an endless
variety to the shafts and capitals of the columns, to the beams, the
walls and ceilings, bewildered the attention, and left not a moment of
repose to the wondering stranger. A lofty central avenue of columns,
above 60 feet high, forming, as it were, a triumphal way, leads under
a third portal, of dimensions by no means inferior to the others
just mentioned, and marked with what care and with what sanctity the
priests guarded every approach to the inner parts of the temple. But
this gateway passed, and a scene the most sublime burst upon the view.
An ample peristyle much larger than the one already passed, presented
itself to the eye, probably planted with trees, crowded with metaphoric
statues.</p>

<p>On either hand a double avenue of columns, less for convenience than
dignity of effect. In the center uprose the portico of the mass of
building, that formed the temple itself&mdash;the columns in dimension
more lofty, in decoration more rich, in proportion more graceful than
those of the courts. The dynasties that had ruled over the country
up to the period of the erection of this temple have their histories
graven on the walls and on the columns. The same pyramidal form gives
an appearance of endless durability to the mass, which is surmounted
by an immense hollowed cavetto having the center occupied by the
sculptured form of the agatho demon, or winged globe and serpents,
with outstretched wings extending over the center intercolumniation of
the facade, and seemingly a being of another world. Admitted beneath
this porch, the minds of the worshipers are prepared for the gloomy
inner penetralia, where every object was mysterious and emblematic.
Numerous doorways closed by curtains succeeded each other, and led from
vestibule to vestibule, which hindered the eye from penetrating with
sacrilegious gaze into the inmost sanctuary, all access to it being
forbidden to the multitude.</p>

<p>To these vestibules the light of day was denied, and the mind was
subdued by the gloom of the spot, for the attention was absorbed by
the contemplation of the sacred mysteries of the place and by the
effects produced on the attention by the huge incongruous figures of
granite&mdash;monstrous reflections of the gloomy minds of the religious
inhabitants of the sacred precinct, who sought to deify matter and the

<h3 id="The_White_Ash"><span class="small">The White Ash.</span></h3>

<p>&#8220;About twenty years ago, Prof. J. L. Budd, of Ames, Iowa, advised
keeping the seeds of the ash through the winter in kegs or boxes, mixed
with clean moist sand, taking care that they become neither too wet
nor too dry. Freezing will do no harm. The ground should be marked and
prepared as for corn, and planting at the intersections, placing four
to six seeds in the hill. They should be carefully cultivated, and the
next spring thinned to one plant in each hill, the vacancies being
supplied. By planting thus thickly, the young trees get a straight
growth. At the end of six years every alternate row north and south
should be thinned out, and at the end of ten years every alternate tree
in each row. When twelve years old, on good soil and proper culture
the first four years the grove would have 12,000 trees on ten acres,
averaging eight inches in diameter. By cutting the stumps close to the
ground, and covering with a light furrow on each side, a second growth
is obtained in eight or ten years, more valuable than the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prof. C. S. Sargent, in speaking of this timber, says: &#8220;To develop
its best qualities, the white ash should be planted in a cool, deep,
moist, but well drained soil, where it will make a rapid growth. That
the plantation may be profitable as early as possible, the young trees
should be inserted in rows three feet apart, the plants being two feet
apart in the rows. This would give 7,260 plants to the acre, which
should be gradually thinned until 108 trees are left standing, twenty
feet apart each way. The first thinning, which might be made at the end
of ten years, would give 4,000 hoop poles, which at present price would
be worth &#36;400.</p>

<p>&#8220;The remaining thinnings, made at different periods up to 25 or 30
years, would produce some three thousand trees more, worth at least
three times as much as the first thinnings. Such cutting would pay all
the expenses of planting, the care of plantation, and the interest
on the capital invested, and would leave the land covered with trees
capable of being turned into money at a moment&#8217;s notice, or whose value
would increase for a hundred years, making no mean inheritance for the
descendants of a Massachusetts farmer. The planting of the white ash
as a shade and roadside tree is especially recommended, and for that
purpose it ranks, among our native trees, next to the sugar maple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prof. B. G. Northrop says in reference to this tree: &#8220;One of the
most valuable of our native trees is the white ash, and, all things
considered, it is one of the most profitable for planting. Combining
lightness, strength, toughness, elasticity, and beauty of grain in
a rare degree, it is in great and growing demand for farming tools,
furniture, interior finishing of houses and railroad cars, the
construction of carriages, for oars and pulley blocks, and many other
purposes. The excellence of our ash is one secret of the preference
given abroad to American agricultural implements. It is hardy, will
bear the bleakest exposure, is a rapid grower and attains large size,
but will not thrive on poor lands. It is every way superior to the
European ash, much as that has been cultivated and lauded abroad. It
is now found widely in the nurseries and young plantations attached
to the forest schools of Europe. Director General Adolfo di Beranger,
president of the Royal Instituto Forestale, at Vallombrosa, pointed me
to his plantations of <i>Fraxinus Americana</i> with a tone which implied
that is the tree of which Americans may well be proud.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ash is a fine ornamental tree for private grounds, public parks,
or for the wayside. When planted closely for timber they grow straight
and free from low laterals, and early reach a size that makes the
thinnings valuable for poles and fencing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The seeds of the white ash are abundant, ripening by the first of
October. They may be easily gathered after the first frost. If sown in
the fall, they should be covered with three inches of straw. If to be
sown in the spring, the seed may be mixed with damp sand.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id="Sawdust"><span class="small">Sawdust.</span></h3>

<p>Sawdust has been a source of worry and expense to mill men in various
ways, though it is to be admitted that in utilizing it to some extent
as fuel they have in part solved the problem of its economical
disposition. Lately, there has sprung up a certain demand for it, and
the problem of its cheap shipment is now one that presents itself.
A Yankee inventor has tried baling it, and appears to have devised
a scheme that accomplishes the purpose successfully. He makes the
sawdust into bales, and has progressed so far as to be able to
compress thirty&#8208;two cubic feet, or a quarter of a cord, into a package
three feet long by two feet on each of its sides. As this occupies
only twelve cubic feet, the reduction is sixty&#8208;two and one&#8208;half per
cent. of its original bulk. The machine used is nothing more than an
ordinary hydraulic press, which is arranged in a manner similar to a
hay or cotton press. The sawdust is pressed into bales and at the same
time inclosed in a burlap covering, making a neat and easily handled
package for shipment. Small pieces of wood, shavings, etc., may be
baled with the sawdust or separately with equal facility. It appears
a simple method of putting this bulky stuff in convenient shape for
shipment, and it would seem might be employed to advantage wherever a
market can be found for this species of mill refuse.&mdash;<i>The Timberman.</i></p>

<h3 id="Fire_Bricks"><span class="small">Fire Bricks.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. W. Y. Dent, in a Cantor lecture at the Society of Arts, London, on
building materials, gave an account of some of the chemical problems
involved in the constituency of fire clay and fire bricks.</p>

<p>The plastic clays consist of silica and alumina chemically combined
with water. They are hydrated silicates of alumina, the plasticity
depending upon the water that enters into their composition. The
water with which the clay is chemically combined can be expelled at
a temperature a little above that of boiling, without detriment to
its plasticity, but the whole of the water contained cannot be driven
off without raising the temperature to dull redness. Silica, alumina,
and lime are separately very infusible substances, and are capable of
resisting exposure to very high temperatures without softening. It is
on account of its extreme infusibility that lime is found to be the
most suitable material for the cylinders upon which the oxyhydrogen
flame is made to impinge to produce a brilliant light, the intensity
of the light being due to the extremely high temperature to which
the lime is raised. Lime, however, from its want of cohesion, could
never be brought into general use for such purposes as fire clay is
employed, and this is also the case as regards silica, which requires
the addition of some substance of a basic character, with which it
will unite, and so cause the particles to bind together. The nearest
approach to the use of silica alone as a fire brick is in the case of
the Welsh brick, made from the Dinas rock in the Vale of Neath.</p>

<p>This material, before being made into fire bricks, had long been used
for repairing the furnaces at the copper works of South Wales, for
which purpose its peculiar property of expanding when subjected to
the influence of a high temperature, instead of contracting, as in
the case of some other fire clays, renders it particularly suitable,
the cementation of the bricks being facilitated by the increase of
temperature. This Dinas rock occurs in various conditions, from that of
a firm rock to that of disintegrated sand, and a mixture of about 1 per
cent. of lime is, therefore, necessary in order to make it into bricks.
Dinas bricks will stand very high temperatures, but are more friable
than ordinary fire bricks, and will not resist to the same extent the
action of basic substances, such as furnace slags, containing much
oxide of iron. They are, besides, porous and readily absorb moisture,
rendering it necessary for furnaces built of them to be gradually
heated, as they are liable to crack if sufficient time is not allowed
for driving off the moisture. The composition of the clay used for
fire bricks is a question of great importance, inasmuch as its quality
depends greatly upon its chemical constituents, although its power of
resisting fusion, when exposed to intense heat, is effected by its
mechanical condition.</p>

<p>The same materials, when mixed together in the form of a coarse powder,
will require a higher temperature to fuse them than would be the
case if they were reduced to a fine state of division. The qualities
required in fire bricks are that they should bear exposure to intense
heat for a long time without fusion, that they should be capable of
being subjected to sudden changes of temperature without injury, and
that they should be able to resist the action of melted copper or iron
slag. The Dinas brick, which contains 98 per cent. of silica, will bear
exposure to a higher temperature than most others, but it will run down
sooner when in contact with melted iron slag. Ganister is the name
given to a fine grit which occurs under certain coal beds in Yorkshire,
Derby, and South Wales, and the black ganister from the neighborhood
of Sheffield is especially adapted for lining cupola furnaces, owing
to its capacity to stand high temperatures without shrinking, in
consequence of the large quantity of silica it contains.</p>

<p>Fire bricks made of silicious clays from granitic deposits in various
parts of Devonshire also contain a large proportion of silica, but
their powers of supporting exposure to high temperatures are materially
increased by the coarseness of the particles of disintegrated granite
of which they are composed. The material employed for the Dinas
bricks, as well as the others mentioned, differs considerably in its
character from what is ordinarily understood by the term fire clay,
as used in the manufacture of the celebrated fire bricks of Blaydon
Burn, Stourbridge, or Glenboig; the quality of which, as regards their
chemical composition, depends upon the relative portions of silica and
alumina, and their freedom from iron oxide and alkaline salts, the
presence of which tends to render the clay more fusible.</p>

<h3 id="Improvements_in_Making_Portland_Cement"><span class="small">Improvements in Making Portland Cement.</span></h3>

<p>Clay is taken as dug from the pit, without being dried, and mixed with
the usual proportion of lime, a portion of which is used as limestone,
the remainder as freshly burnt lime. The burnt lime is first added in
such proportion that the water in the clay exactly suffices to slake
it, and the heat given out effects the necessary drying. The limestone
is then added and the mixture ground in a mill to the usual degree of
fineness, made into bricks, calcined, and the &#8220;clinker&#8221; reduced to a
fine state of division as usual.</p>

<h3 id="Typhoid_Fever_Carried_by_Well_Water"><span class="small">Typhoid Fever Carried by Well Water.</span></h3>

<p>The following account of the transmittal of cases of typhoid fever by
well water is sent us by Dr. Henry B. Baker, secretary of the Michigan
State Board of Health. It is made to him by Dr. H. McColl, of Lapeer,
Mich.</p>

<p>Dr. McColl reports: About September 1, 1887, Myron Gardner, railroad
employe, came from the South sick with fever to his father&#8217;s house. He
was supposed to be malarial. No care was exercised with stools in the
way of disinfection, but they were thrown into privy vault in rear of
house, and in close proximity to well. Wash water was thrown on the
surface of the ground, which was very dry at the time. About September
7 or 8, a copious rain fell and soaked the sandy soil; and on September
14, Wm. Gardner and wife, father and mother of Myron, and E. D. Gardner,
a brother &#40;who was a student in my office&#41;, and who boarded at home,
were attacked with fever. On this day I got home from Washington, and
found four of them down with a severe type of typhoid fever; and in two
weeks Myron&#8217;s wife and child were attacked; also a child across the
street at Terry&#8217;s, who had used water from the Gardner well; about the
same time three cases in the Clifford house, south of Gardner&#8217;s, who
also used water from the Gardner well. None of the people from either
of these houses were in the Gardner house. In the Walker house, still
further south, one case has occurred, and I was at a loss to account
for this case till a few days ago, when the young man said that at the
mill where he was working they had used the Gardner water for a few
days, owing to the disarrangement of the pump at the mill. Two others
of the mill hands&mdash;Anderson and Lester&mdash;who used the same water were
attacked about the same time. Lester is now convalescent. Anderson is
dead, as also the child at Terry&#8217;s. When I took charge of the cases,
I ordered the discontinuance of water from the Gardner well and the
disinfection of the stools, and no new cases are now reported. People
who assisted to take care of the Gardner and other families, and who
use water from other sources, have not been attacked. Clearly, Myron
Gardner brought the fever home, the well became infected after the
first rain from slops and privy, and the other cases got their seed
from the water.</p>

<p>Dr. Baker adds: The foregoing instructive account of the way typhoid
fever was spread, in one instance, is produced in the hope that
it may lead others to trace the spread of this important disease,
and, what is of greater importance, act intelligently for the
prevention and restriction of the disease, as Dr. McColl did in this
instance.&mdash;<i>Sanitary News.</i></p>

<h3 id="An_Unsafe_Church"><span class="small">An Unsafe Church.</span></h3>

<p>About a month ago, Inspector of Buildings Griffin discovered that the
wall on the southern side of the Warren Avenue Baptist Church, Boston,
Mass., was bulging. He climbed to the roof, and was astonished to find
that the scissors truss that supported the pitch of the roof was not
bolted together, but was fastened only with railroad spikes.</p>

<p>The wall was out of plumb fully nine inches. A peremptory order was
issued to vacate the church. Then a more careful examination was made,
with startling results.</p>

<p>The truss was laid bare, and then it was discovered that the sole
support for the roof of the great building consisted of three iron rods
one and one half inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The cross rods were of no use, because the wood had shrunk away and
the bolts could be rattled. The upper and lower chords of the truss
were made of eight two&#8208;inch planks, and where the cross rods had been
put through and clinched the auger had cut off one plank and part of
another, weakening the truss by one&#8208;eighth.</p>

<p>The lower chord of the truss was cut completely through in two places.
It is said that it will cost nearly &#36;200,000 to repair the church,
which is one of the largest in the city.</p>

<p>It would not be a bad idea for the trustees of other churches to have
the trusses carefully examined.</p>

<h3 id="Cedar_Pavements"><span class="small">Cedar Pavements.</span></h3>

<p>To pave a city with cedar would seem to be a luxury, but it appears
that in the city of Chicago, out of 277.71
miles of paved streets, there are 213.35 miles of cedar blocks, of
which nearly forty miles was laid last year, and the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>
says it is the cheapest pavement laid in the city. Dead cedar brought
from the vicinity of Green Bay, Wis., was first used, but it was found
that it did not wear well, and live timber is now required. The cedar
is a tree which does not taper rapidly, and one of good size should
furnish a stick 30 ft. long. The logs are brought here by boats in
lengths of about 6 ft., with the bark still on, peeled, and cut into
blocks 5 in. long. The blocks range in diameter from 3 in. to 9 in.,
and cost 50 to 60 cents a yard, measurement being made after they are
laid. The process of paving a street with cedar blocks is much the same
as was used with the Nicholson pavement. A sand foundation is first
provided, and on this are laid boards which serve as stringers. On
the stringers planks are placed parallel with the curb, and the cedar
blocks are stood on end on the planks. The interstices between the
blocks are filled with gravel and coal tar.</p>

<p>For the last three years block pavement has cost in Chicago from &#36;1.00
to &#36;1.30 a yard. The life of cedar block pavement is three to seven
years, and it is an excellent pavement when first laid. It is believed
by many to be detrimental to health from the fact that it absorbs all
liquids falling upon it, gives them back in the shape of vapor under
the influence of the sun, and is itself constantly decaying. It is
stated as a curious fact that this pavement wears out faster on streets
where traffic is light than where it is heavy. Cedar blocks are used
for paving all through the West, but more freely probably in Chicago
than in any other city in the world. They are cheap, and that is a
great point in their favor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3 id="Hemlock"><span class="small">Hemlock.</span></h3>

<p>Respecting the merits of hemlock, the <i>Minneapolis Lumberman</i> has
a good word in its last issue. It quotes from a correspondent at
Williamsport, Pa., regarding the experience with the wood there as a
foundation for paving blocks; and in regard to a stretch of Nicholson
pavement there which had been down sixteen years, goes on to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;The blocks had been placed on two thicknesses of one inch hemlock, the
boards coated both sides with coal tar. When the pavement was taken
up, the boards were found to be in good condition&mdash;so perfectly sound
that they were put back again for possibly another sixteen years. The
correspondent says that out of a mile of sixty foot street, less than
10,000 feet of the old planking was condemned. There seems to be no
question as to the superlative merit of hemlock for paving purposes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is valuable testimony, and better evidence of the lasting
qualities of hemlock under paving blocks than any Western experience
has produced, for the reason that it has nowhere in the West been
so long as that in use. It has been recognized, however, as a wood
excellently suited to this purpose, and is employed almost exclusively
wherever the cedar block pavement is freely used, which includes a
good many of the large cities in the United States, and practically
all Western towns in which any paving is done. It is apparent that
lumbermen are beginning to take a strong interest in hemlock, and
evidences of its growth in favor are becoming rather plentiful. It
occasionally gets a setback from some local dealer, who has come off
second best in an encounter with its slivers, but it is bound to come
more and more in use in spite of the strong objection that is made to
it by some users. Its light weight and great strength for many building
purposes are factors that tell.&mdash;<i>Timberman.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3 id="Collapse_of_Walls_of_Burning_Buildings"><span class="small">Collapse of Walls of Burning Buildings.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Alex. Black, writing to the <i>Building News</i>, says: The expansion
of brick by fire heat may be estimated at rather above half that of
wrought iron; and of mortar at about one&#8208;fourth more than that of
wrought iron. The mortar joints in the wall may occupy, say, one&#8208;fifth
to one&#8208;sixth of the height of the wall. There is no accurate data as
to the maximum heat developed at Whiteley&#8217;s fire. It, however, depends
on the nature of the contents, etc., consumed and the accumulation of
draught currents. If there is free lime, etc., in brick or mortar,
there is added to the expansion more or less disintegration, which
would become not the least potent cause of collapse.</p>

<p>We may assume that the interior surface of the brickwork exposed to
the fire expanded, say, 1 in. in 8 ft. or 10 ft., vertically and
horizontally, which would produce a distortion by buckling, or curving
inward, dish&#8208;like, of the inside half thickness of the wall, both
vertically and horizontally, leaving for a time the outside half
thickness &#40;say, for convenience of description&#41; not much disturbed;
in the meanwhile, air gets in between these inside and outside half
thicknesses, or slices, and it may become gradually expanded by heat
and help to force them further apart until the whole wall collapses.</p>

<p>In setting iron girders, the usual practice appears to be to build the
ends solidly in the wall to act as a tie; but by having cross flanges
at ends the wall may be built close to these on inside toward interior
of building, and space left for expansion on their outside; but this
space is of no use without the ends of the girders are set upon rollers
or rockers, as is done for bridge girders, because the rigidity of wall
would not be sufficient to withstand undisturbed the expansive pushing
out, or horizontal thrust, of loaded girder end if resting upon a rough
bearing plate or block.</p>

<p>If building timber joists into walls, it is a safe method to bevel off
the upper corner equal to the bearing of the end in the wall, which
allows the projecting portion of joist, if broken accidentally, to drop
down without disturbing the wall, by the leverage which it would exert
if built in the wall in the usual way.</p>

<h3 id="A_2500_CALIFORNIA_HOUSE">A &#36;2,500 CALIFORNIA HOUSE.</h3>

<p>California can justly boast of a larger number of pretty places and
picturesque localities in which to erect residences of moderate cost
than can be found in any other State in the Union. The beautiful town
of Alameda, covering, as it does, a large extent of ground, embracing
several square miles, may be regarded as a paradise for those who wish
a quiet retreat, away from the din and confusion of the city, and yet
be in close connection with the great mart. Nearly every portion of
the town is covered with a natural growth of oak trees. Nor does this
growth stop at this point. For a long distance to the north the ground
is covered by the beautiful trees from which the neighboring city of
Oakland derives its name.</p>

<p>Extremes meet in architecture as well as other matters. Some æsthetic
persons have sought to copy the humble abode of the laborer in the
external view of a dwelling, while the internal arrangements and
fittings rival those of Aladdin&#8217;s palace. Others seek to have the
outside present to the eye a conglomeration of whimsical ideas, while
they have not deigned to cover the floors with a carpet, nor have a
door between any of the rooms or halls, excepting those connecting with
the outer world.</p>

<p>Much benefit has been derived from these whimsical erections, and it
is only by much study and close application to the fancies of their
clients that architects have been enabled to prepare the beautiful
bijou plans, a good representation of which is given in this issue. In
justice to the architectural profession, we must say that no portion
of their practice has been so usefully bestowed as that which has been
bestowed upon the production of plans for such homes, a full plan of
which accompanies this article.</p>

<p>The elevation, as shown, is a model of neatness and economy. At once
attractive in appearance and substantial in all its surroundings, it
does away with all those horrible idiosyncrasies and bugbears of the
Elizabethan and Queen Anne styles. There are no small windows to cause
the one who cleans them to utter a whole vocabulary of cuss words at
the architect who made so many corners to dig out. There is no part of
California but what needs all the sunshine that was intended to enter a
room, and the large windows shown allow the heat and light to make glad
the hearts of the dwellers therein. Even with the thermometer at 100
degrees and over in the shade at noontime, still, when evening comes,
the cool winds that invariably bless the sleep of those who are tired
from their daily toil has easy ingress from these same large windows.
And in winter, from the absence of snow in all of our beautiful
valleys, the same windows are a source of joy and comfort for the
occupants to observe the driving rains, or admit the blessed sunshine
as it pierces through the wintry clouds.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in painting the exterior. The colors
selected should be a happy blending of light and dark shades. They
should be graded from rich, heavy grades at the bottom to the lighter
tones at the gable peaks, preserving, through the intermediate section,
a consistent harmony. The roof may be of dark slate color. The
trimmings may be colored with a combination of blue, black, and Indian
red. The body of the house may be varied to suit the above. It must be
distinctly borne in mind that all buildings of the same class cannot be
treated alike. Trees have a wonderful effect on colors used, and the
main study of the painter and owner should be that the salient points
of form and detail be enhanced by the proper selection of the various
colors. By all means, if you are building a home for yourself, take the
good wife into your confidence, and let her judgment be given on the
various colors to be used.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the rooms, as shown by the plan, is very desirable
for any one with a small family. A feature is made of the entrance
way. From the hall, one can pass either to the parlor or dining room,
the latter being the general sitting room. The parlor is large&mdash;13
× 17 feet in size. It has a fireplace, as shown. A cornice is also
designated. Sliding doors connect this room with the dining room, the
size of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> being 12 × 17¾ feet. A cornice and fireplace are
also shown. In case of company or family gathering, the two rooms will
be practically one. The porch shown in front will be very handy for the
gentlemen who smoke, or, on warm days the ladies can use the same for
sewing purposes, sheltered, as the plans show, by the roof overhead.</p>

<p>You pass from this room into a hall, from which you can enter all the
rest of the rooms. The main chamber is 12 feet 6 inches by 16 feet 6
inches, besides a large bay window, having four windows for light and
air. There is also a cornice in this room, and a place for a stove to
connect with parlor chimney. There is a very large closet, and also
wash room, which is well lighted and ventilated. Passing along the
hall, we next come to a large linen closet. This will be found very
serviceable for the storage of the linen in daily use. Then comes a
large chamber, 11 feet 6 inches by 12 feet. No cornice is shown. Should
a fire be needed in this room, a patent flue could be placed therein,
starting from near the ceiling. A large closet is also connected with
this room. At the end of the hall is the bath room, 6 feet 3 inches by
9 feet 6 inches. A wash bowl and water closet are shown. The window,
being directly over the tub, assures perfect ventilation.</p>

<p>On opposite side of hall from bath room is a room designated as
breakfast room, in size 10 × 11 feet, with two windows. This can be
used as a bed room, should the dining room suffice for the needs of
the occupants of the house. This room is very convenient, as it can be
reached by three different ways. The next room is the kitchen, in size
10 × 13 feet, with plenty of light and ample means of ventilation. The
place for the stove pipe is indicated by the dotted lines leading to
the dining room chimney. Should it be found more desirable to have the
stove in a different position from that indicated, a patent flue can be
put in, starting near the ceiling. A large pass closet, amply fitted
with drawers and shelves, connects with the dining room. There is also
a large pantry fitted up with bins, etc.</p>

<p>A stairway is shown, near breakfast room, leading to the attic. No plan
is given of the latter, as the space can be divided according to the
individual tastes of the parties building. The rear hall is 3 feet 6
inches wide.</p>

<p>The whole plan is very compact, and will bear careful study. The detail
drawings, as shown, will give an adequate idea of the various finishes.
Each one is distinctly marked.</p>

<p>The internal decoration of the structure represented in the
accompanying engravings is due to Mr. Arnaud, an architect at
Carcassonne. The front already existed in part, and merely the
finishing of it is due to him. As for the parlor and dining room, of
which we give an illustration, these two rooms, like the rest, were
studied with very artistic care by Mr. Arnaud, and the execution of the
work was closely watched.</p>

<p>The chimney that decorates the dining room is of Echaillon stone, and
was made at the works of Mr. G. Biron. It is 14 feet in height, and
cost, all carved, &#36;1,400. The flooring of the rooms is of oak, of two
colors, and was put down by the house of Idrac, of Toulouse, which
makes a specialty of old oak inlaid floors. The color of the old oak,
introduced into the very substance of the wood, lasts an indefinite
length of time. The wainscoting of the dining room and that of the
parlor is of walnut, and forms a frame, in the case of the dining
room, for old tapestry. In the parlor the panels are covered with
large&#8208;figured cretonne.</p>

<p>The ceilings are of plaster, with mouldings. To that of the dining
room are affixed, by invisible hooks, some old Japanese plates. These
produce a very happy effect in the ceiling as a whole, and in nowise
injure it. The ceilings are painted in softening tints, the principal
of which are red, blue and maroon. The dining room cost, as a whole,
&#36;3,600, the old tapestry included. It is 24 × 30 feet, and the parlor
is 28 × 37 feet.&mdash;<i>La Construction Moderne</i>.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Revue Horticole</i> states that he has been
completely successful in saving both his vines and haricot beans from
being totally destroyed by the rabbits which swarm in this district by
using a remedy which he terms the &#8220;Bouillie bordelaise.&#8221; This consists
of a mixture of sulphate of copper &#40;bluestone or blue vitriol&#41; and
fresh slaked lime, in the proportion of 3¼ lb. of the former to
4½ lb. of quicklime in twenty&#8208;one gallons of water. The bluestone
is first dissolved in a bucket of water, the quicklime is then slaked,
and when cool it is thrown along with the dissolved bluestone into a
barrel or other vessel of sufficient size; water is then added to make
up twenty&#8208;one gallons, and the whole is well stirred up. The mixture is
conveniently applied with a whitewash brush, and in fine, dry weather
only should it be used. The object of the lime in the mixture is to
counteract any ill effects that the sulphate of copper or bluestone
might have on the vegetable tissues, and also to indicate that no part
of the stem or plant which it is intended to protect has been passed
over without receiving its proper share of the application.</p>

<h3 id="Ice_House"><span class="small">How to Build an Ice House.</span></h3>

<p>Under this head the <i>American Architect</i> advises a correspondent as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The ice house floor should be above the level of the ground, or, at
least, should be sufficiently above some neighboring area to give an
outfall for a drain, put in in such a way as to keep the floor clear of
standing water.</p>

<p>2. The walls should be hollow. A four inch lining wall, tied to the
outer wall with hoop iron, and with a three inch air space, would
answer, but it would be better, if the air space is thoroughly drained,
to fill it with mineral wool, or some similar substance, to prevent
the movement of the air entangled in the fibers, and thus check the
transference by convection of heat from the outside to the lining wall.</p>

<p>3. A roof of thick plank will keep out heat far better than one of thin
boards with an air space under it.</p>

<p>4. Shingles will be much better for roofing than slate.</p>

<p>5. It is best to ventilate the upper portion of the building. If no
ventilation is provided, the confined air under the roof becomes
intensely heated in summer, and outlets should be provided at the
highest part, with inlets at convenient points, to keep the temperature
of the air over the ice at least down to that of the exterior
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Rhode Island State board of health has completed its investigation
of the epidemic of typhoid fever at Conanicut park hotel, made last
summer.</p>

<p>At the opening of the season of 1887 trouble was experienced, but no
action was taken. Soon the people in the house began to be ill, and at
a time when all the rooms were taken and many more guests were to come
and occupy the cottage apartments. From the first symptoms, which were
not considered serious, the disease, which proved to be typhoid fever,
assumed a violent form, and Dr. Jernigan, on whose advice several
patients had come to the island, directed a practical plumber to make a
thorough examination of the premises.</p>

<p>The plumber discovered that the pipes leading from the water closets
had leaked into the cellar, and that from all appearances the leak
had existed from the first of the season. The sewage had run into the
well from which the water was drawn for general uses about the hotel.
Prior to the discovery of the contamination of the water, its sparkling
qualities had been praised by all the guests. The plumber also reported
that the ground near the well was saturated with the sewage, and that
when disturbed the earth emitted an overpowering and sickening stench.
From the cellar the investigation was continued to the well at the
north end of the house. It was dug quite recently, and the shaft had
been sunk through an old drain leading to a cesspool, and a portion of
the drain constituted a section of the well shaft.</p>

<p>The State board of health proposes to ask for an appropriation this
winter sufficient to pay for a careful examination of all the hotels
in the State, and the inspection and analysis of all waters used for
drinking purposes where there is liability of contamination.&mdash;<i>Sanitary

<h3 id="Arch_Construction"><span class="small">Arch Construction.</span></h3>

<p>Iron construction has so completely superseded masonry for bridge
building that it would appear almost unnecessary to discuss the
question of the equilibrated arch for any large span. But the
mathematical principles of the arch have always been an interesting
subject with geometricians and theorists, and the theory, at any rate,
ought to form one of the subjects of the architect&#8217;s and engineer&#8217;s
education. As a problem of the equilibrium of forces, the theory of
arch construction is instructive, inasmuch as it presents us with
a concrete example of three forces balanced in a structure. The
other day, at the opening of the engineering section of the Bristol
Naturalists&#8217; Society, at University College, Bristol, the president,
Mr. Charles Richardson, C.E., read a paper on arch building, in which
he advocated the employment of arches of equilibrium for bridges. The
author referred to the well known and elegant property of the balanced
arch, which is derived from the principle of the catenary or suspended
chain or inverted polygon of bars, each bar or link assuming the
position &#40;inverted&#41; that the arch stones of an equilibrated arch would
have. In Dr. Hutton&#8217;s valuable &#8220;Tracts on Bridges,&#8221; this principle is
followed in his elucidation of the arch, and readers of that work will
remember the diagrams given of various kinds of balanced arches, and
the curves of extrados necessary to insure equilibrium. The theory,
indeed, is older than Hutton. Belidor and Dr. Hooke both investigated
the form of the extrados from the nature of the curve, and this theory
has been made the foundation of a very interesting system of designing
arches. According to this theory of the question, the stones are
considered free from all friction&mdash;a condition which does not hold in
practice. Mr. Richardson follows, as far as we can see, this theory.
He enunciated the theorem that the weight on any point of the arch is
proportional to the vertical line from the road line to the intrados at
that point; that the horizontal thrust is the same throughout the arch,
and is equal to the weight on the crown per unit of area multiplied by
the radius of curvature there; and also that the bed pressure at any
point is equal to the horizontal thrust multiplied by the secant of
the angle the curve makes with the horizon at that point. This rule
is thoroughly mathematical and true for arches of equilibrium; and
the author exhibited an instructive model of an arch equilibrated,
and showed by inverting it, and suspending a chain weighted by steel
rods representing the loads at each point, that the latter coincided
with the road line. But the engineer&#8208;architect has to do with arches
in which the element of friction enters; the stones are cemented, and
therefore the theory, however beautiful, does not hold good in every
case. Instead of the separate arch stones or voussoirs, he has to
deal with segments of the arch which turn upon certain edges. Thus
an arch which fails breaks into four parts, the crown sinks, and the
haunches rise, the joints at those points opening. One of the questions
to decide is the points at which rupture occurs, that being found to
find out what horizontal pressure each of those lower segments have
to sustain. From knowing the thrust and its point of action, the
stability of the arch will depend on the mass and weight of the pier.
The experiments of Rondelet and others have proved that the voussoirs
unite into segments of the arch, and tend to overturn the abutment,
acting rather as levers than wedges. He found, also, that the greatest
thrust was in arches with an even number of voussoirs or a point at the
vertex; that a keystone lessened the thrust. Nevertheless, the theory
of equilibration should be known by all architects and bridge builders.</p>

<p>In alluding to the materials, the author showed the impossibility of
dressing and bedding stones accurately. Practically, the stone built
arch is difficult to execute with precision. The facing stones only
are cut to the true curve, the backing being filled in with rubble
and roughly executed. With brickwork the bricks can be all bedded in
cement, being more convenient for handling, and a vitrified brick is
equal at least to the best stone in resistance. The brick arch should
be built in vertical bond, not in rings. Mr. Richardson finds that,
taking the safe load in cement at 5 cwt. upon the square inch, an arch
15 in. thick at the springing and 12⅚ at the crown is sufficient
for a span of 85 feet with a rise of ⅛ of the span. He says: &#8220;As
all loads and thrusts on such an arch are in direct proportion, if
each dimension were multiplied by four, we should have a span of 340
feet with a rise of 42 feet and an arch thickness of 5 feet. This 5
feet thickness would give a sufficient margin of safety for the moving
load, because 5 feet is only the necessary thickness at the springing,
while that at the crown would be 9 in. less. The total weight of this
bridge would be 100,000 tons.&#8221; Ring&#8208;built arches are advisedly objected
to, as the rings tend to separate when any settlement takes place.
Mr. Richardson does not rely too much on friction, and he is right.
There can be no scientific arch construction that is not based on the
principle of equilibrium, the line of thrust being kept within the
middle third of the arch thickness; and in designing arches of brick
or stone the engineer should always be able by diagram to satisfy
himself of this condition. Whenever the line of thrust passes close to
the lower edge of the arch ring at the haunches, there must be undue
pressure and a tendency to open at the other edge. In other words, the
arch is inclined to drop at the crown. When it passes out of the arch,
failure must take place sooner or later. Instead of first deciding upon
the curve and road line, as is frequently done, the right course is to
find the line of thrust for the given span and loading, and then make
the arch conform as nearly as possible to this line. We agree with the
opinion that brickwork, if correctly applied, would be found to excel
iron construction in strength, durability, and economy&mdash;certainly in
appearance. In the construction of masonry arches, sufficient care
is not always bestowed upon the drainage of the arches&mdash;a cause, we
imagine, of many failures.&mdash;<i>Building News.</i></p>

<h3 id="NEW_FORM_OF_CHIMES_FOR_CHURCHES">NEW FORM OF CHIMES FOR CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>A new form of chimes for churches is being introduced in England,
which are said to give much satisfaction. They consist of a series
of metallic tubes suspended from a beam, as shown in our engraving.
They are struck by hammers, are very resonant, loud, and pleasing. A
correspondent of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, speaking of their effect,
says: &#8220;The music of many tuneful bells, harmonious, ever changing,
lending themselves to any simple air, easy of management, and mellowed
as the sound of cathedral bells.... Such music I have heard at
Coventry.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3 id="Tube_Chimes"><span class="small">Tube Chimes.</span></h3>

<p>The new invention which goes under the name of tube chimes is a musical
chime in which metal tubes instead of bells are employed. The tube
chimes can be used for any purpose that bells are used for, and besides
are an economical substitute for bells. They are remarkable also for
a depth and richness of tone which one does not expect to find except
in high class cathedral bells. A tube chime for a church belfry is
especially suitable. The carrying power is not quite equal to that of
bells. A chime was lately set up in the tower of one of the Dorsetshire
churches which has pleased all concerned. Rung for the first time on
occasion of the harvest festival, it caused both delight and surprise
by the sweet and melodious tones it gave out. The invention has not
long been brought under public notice, but the demand for household
octaves in place of the inharmonious gong is already very large. Mr.
Harrington has a taste for music, and the idea of adapting tubes of
metal for the musical purposes of bells is no new one. It has taken,
though, many years of experiment and study to perfect the principle.
One difficulty, which was a great obstacle in the way, may be alluded
to. The large chimes are rung by bell ropes, but, contrary to the
plan of bells, there is an external hammer instead of the internal
clapper. If the hammers were made of sufficient hardness to prevent
wear and tear, the chime lost its sweet tones and became harsh. If the
hammers were less hard, they would constantly require to be replaced.
Fortunately, that difficulty, like many others, has been satisfactorily
got over. The chimes can be, it should be noted, tuned to any desired
pitch, and Messrs. Harrington &amp; Co. are probably warranted when they
say: &#8220;The introduction of this invention will, we are assured, mark
the commencement of a new era in connection with church bells and
carillons, chimes for clocks of all sizes, dinner calls and gongs, and
all mechanisms in which musical bells are used or required, and in some
of these departments bids fair to work a complete revolution.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The

<p>At the residence of Sir Harry Verney, Claydon House, Buckinghamshire,
a deputation from the Working Men&#8217;s Club of Whatstandwell, Derbyshire,
recently waited on Miss Florence Nightingale, for the purpose of
presenting to her an oil painting, by Mr. E. Crosland, of her late
home, Lea Hurst, as a token of their esteem, and in recognition of
the great interest taken by her in that institution. The deputation,
consisting of Mr. F. C. Iveson, Mr. Crosland, the artist, and Mr.
W. Peacock, assured Miss Nightingale of the love felt for her by
all classes of people at Whatstandwell and in that district, and of
their gratitude for her kindness and help in every good work. Miss
Nightingale, in thanking them for the present, which she admired very
much, expressed her continued great interest in the institution and its
members, and assured them of her hopes for its welfare. The deputation
were entertained at Claydon House by Sir Harry and Lady Verney. We are

<p class="caption">LEA HURST, DERBYSHIRE, THE HOME OF MISS FLORENCE
NIGHTINGALE.</p></div>

<p>Miss Florence Nightingale is a lady whose name has been deservedly
honored in England since the Crimean war and has become the symbol
of a particular type of personal efforts in the service of afflicted
humanity. She was born at Florence, in May, 1820, youngest daughter
and coheiress of W. E. Nightingale, Esq., of Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, and
Embley Park, Hampshire. She devoted her attention to the working of
schools for the poor, juvenile reformatories, and hospitals, inspecting
many such institutions on the Continent, and residing, in 1851, with
the Protestant Sisters of Mercy at Kaiserswerth, on the Rhine. She next
bestowed her care and gifts of her money on the London Governesses&#8217;
Sanatorium in Harley street. During the Crimean war, in 1854, when
the inefficient state of our military hospitals in the East demanded
instant reform, the hospital at Scutari, opposite Constantinople, was
established for the relief of sick and wounded British soldiers and
prisoners. It was resolved to form a select band of volunteer lady
superintendents and female nurses for this and other army hospitals.
At the request of the Secretary of State for the War Department,
Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterward Lord Herbert of Lea, Miss Nightingale
undertook the task of organizing and directing this service, which
she performed in a manner universally admired, and which earned her
the personal friendship of the Queen, with many public and private
expressions of gratitude and esteem. A testimonial fund amounting to
&#36;250,000 was subscribed in recognition of her patriotic and benevolent
work, and was, at her special desire, applied to create and maintain an
institution for the training of nurses. Miss Nightingale&#8217;s impaired
health, for many years past, has debarred her from active public
exertions but she has continued to study the plans and operations of
those charitable agencies on which she is a high authority, and has
written brief treatises on subjects of much practical importance. Her
&#8220;Notes on Hospitals,&#8221; printed in 1859; &#8220;Notes on Nursing,&#8221; in 1860;
and &#8220;Notes on Lying&#8208;in Institutions,&#8221; and on the training of midwives
and midwifery nurses, in 1871, were of considerable utility. She also
wrote, in 1863, valuable observations on the sanitary condition of
the army in India, and has furnished to the War Office useful reports
and suggestions concerning the army medical department.&mdash;<i>Illustrated

<h3><span class="small">Painting.</span></h3>

<p>In order to use paints and oils economically, a clear understanding of
their purpose and action is absolutely necessary. Linseed oil is said
to &#8220;dry&#8221; after being applied. That is only partially true. It rather
oxidizes and changes to a tough, gummy substance not unlike hard glue.
This action is accelerated by the use of &#8220;driers,&#8221; as they are called.
But in no case does it give the same results as when left to dry of
its own free will. The carbonate of lead or mineral which is added to
the oil gives the color and assists in making up the body. The life of
the paint is the oil, and when it is oxidized, it alone is the binding
element. Upon it depends the durability of the paint. A piece of wood
dipped in linseed oil and hung up to dry, or oxidize, in the air, will
soon become covered with a beautiful translucent film of oxidized oil,
which grows harder daily. It will take a high polish and preserve the
wood. Another piece dipped in carbonate of lead, or mineral, mixed in
turpentine, or any fluid to allow it to spread evenly over the surface,
will when dry have a dead or flat color without polish or body to
bind it together, and the slightest abrasion will remove portions of
it. All painting is done either with pure oils or with the admixture
of a fluid like turpentine, which assists in the distribution of the
mineral, but does not add to the body. When the surface of wood has
been covered with a thick coating of oxidized oil, it can be washed and
rubbed to look clean and polished. Boats, when of a light color, are
often painted with a mixture containing much turpentine, in order that
all marks may be removed with a little beach sand, by rubbing off the
mineral, which is not bound together securely by oil, but only loosely
by turpentine. Car builders now often paint their cars or varnish them
a second time soon after the first, say after about six months&#8217; run.
This gives them a good coat of oxidized oil to withstand the weather
and preserve the wood. A few coats applied within short intervals
produce a fine covering which is very durable and will take a polish
after washing.&mdash;<i>Master Mechanic.</i></p>

<h3 id="Removal_of_Chimneys"><span class="small">Removal of Chimneys.</span></h3>

<p>An interesting scene was caused recently by the blowing up of the
two immense chimneys on Borsig&#8217;s machine works in Berlin. A large
number of spectators were present to witness the ceremony, including
several officers of the army, the trustees of the Borsig estates, and
the employes of the works. Punctually at five minutes past six P. M.,
the signal to &#8220;Look out!&#8221; was given; then came the word of command,
&#8220;Fire!&#8221; and at this moment the vast chimney, towering to a height of
say 120 feet 9 inches, quietly collapsed. The noise occasioned by the
fall was not very great, ditches two meters in breadth having been
dug all round the chimney and filled with straw. For blowing up this
colossus, which consisted of 98,000 bricks and was topped with a heavy
iron cap weighing twenty&#8208;five centners, only 24 kilos of dynamite were
employed. Photographs were taken of the chimney before it fell, and
also as it was in the act of falling, by an officer of the Commission
for Experimenting with Explosives. The second chimney standing about
80 feet high, was blasted with gun cotton, of which 35 kilos were
required.</p>

<h3 id="HOMES_OF_FACTORY_OPERATIVES">HOMES OF FACTORY OPERATIVES.</h3>

<p>The institution of the factory system changed the workshop home of the
domestic system to the home proper by transferring work to the factory.
As a result, the homes of the operatives under the factory system have
undergone a great change, and are still undergoing changes, which are
making the English significance of the word &#8220;home&#8221; a reality to the
poorest. It is perfectly true that in every large factory town one can
find loathsome dwellings occupied by groups of persons called families.
In most factory towns, both in America and Europe, it is easy to find
dwellings occupied by factory operatives which are a disgrace to the
owners and the municipality. Yet, taking the operative population of
such towns as a class, they are very comfortably housed, and about as
well housed in one country as another. The personal inspection of more
than 1,000 homes of factory operatives leads Mr. Carroll D. Wright to
this conclusion, he having written a special report on the &#8220;Factory
System of the United States&#8221; for the Census Bureau.</p>

<p>British factory houses being floored with stone, as a rule, present
a cold and cheerless look. The dimensions of the British house are
much smaller than factory houses in America. The tenements of three
rooms have much less space than tenements of three rooms here. This is
generally true of all European factory towns. But the houses of the
operatives are, as a rule, separate ones, the tenement house being
quite unknown except where what is termed the &#8220;model workingmen&#8217;s
houses&#8221; are being tried. The boarding house is not an institution for
factory operatives.</p>

<p class="largeimg"><a href="images/illus017a_large.jpg">Larger image</a> &#40;218 kB&#41;</p></div>

<p>At Saltaire, near Bradford, the homes of the work&#8208;people are excellent;
rents vary from &#36;30 to &#36;100 per year for three to five room houses. The
houses are neat, tidy, and prettily furnished. At Queensbury, where
John Foster &amp; Son have works, the weavers earn 15 to 18 shillings per
week full run, and the rents are 84 cents per week for three rooms.
Some of the best houses in England are at Copley village, in Halifax,
built by James Akroyd &amp; Sons. They rent three rooms for £10 per year,
and the operatives are helped to acquire a freehold. The Crowleys
at Halifax employ 5,000 people, who have good houses. The houses at
Salford and Manchester are not so good. The factories at Paisley are
excellent evidences of the good influence which arises from proper
interest in employes. The works of the Messrs. Clark and Messrs. Coates
are model establishments and the influence of model works extends to
the houses of the people employed, which are here very comfortable.
Rents vary from 72 cents to &#36;2 per week, according to number of rooms.</p>

<p>In Glasgow no cellarages can now be found. The operatives have gone
to the suburbs, where they have changed their cramped city abodes for
clean and light houses. Belfast, Ireland, is improving the dwellings of
the linen factory operatives. The houses are tidy, and rents are from
48 to 60 cents per week for four rooms. There are houses with flats
in Belfast. In the west and east of Scotland the operatives live very
largely in flats; rents in Dundee and Dunfermline being for two rooms
from &#36;15 to &#36;30 per year, and for three or four rooms from &#36;30 to &#36;50
per year.</p>

<p>Among the most substantial houses for workingmen will be found
those of Herr Krupp, in Essen, Rhenish Prussia. By his system of
employment he has the selection of the best mechanics in Europe. This
system comprehends all the advantages to be found in model industrial
establishments, including excellent tenements and gardens at low
rents. A foreman, a gun&#8208;maker, earning &#36;45 per month, receives four
rooms, a drying place on the roof, a cellar, and a garden for &#36;45 per
year. A workman with wages at 75 cents per day pays &#36;37 per year for
three large rooms, drying place, cellar, and garden. There are fair
tenements, in two or three story blocks, situated in colonies just
outside the towns. For &#36;100 per year, one can obtain a most excellent
tenement of seven large rooms, cellar, garden, etc. The houses in
the colonies are owned by Herr Krupp. In fact, he believes that he
receives better results by owning everything, and by being able thereby
to control the sanitary surroundings of the dwellings of his people.
These colonies, each having its name, are laid out with park, schools,
churches, supply stores, etc. The housing of the single men is on the
barrack plan.</p>

<p>It may be stated that the houses in Great Britain and on the Continent
are of stone or brick, as the locality may afford, and the neat wood
cottage of America cannot be found. It is quite impossible to compare
the houses of European factory operatives with those of the same class
in America. The great mass of the former are, generally speaking, quite
as well housed as the latter, so far as the quality of the house is
concerned; but so far as quantity of room and excellence of living are
concerned, the advantage is with the operatives of America. When the
operative of this country steps out of the boarding or the tenement
house, he steps into an individual home the equal of which cannot be
found in the factory towns of the Old World.</p>

<p>The cottage of the American factory operative, when he sees fit to
occupy one, is superior to the cottage of the workingman of any other
country. It is most gratifying to know that the individual homes are
not only increasing in number in this country, but they are increasing
in influence. In all the leading factory towns this is the course of
progress.</p>

<p>The plates we give on this page represent one of the styles of modern
cottages built by the Willimantic Linen Co., of Willimantic, Conn. With
each cottage is quite a garden of several thousand feet of land. The
rent is from &#36;60 to &#36;125 per year. These houses are located in such a
way as to exhibit variety of styles; that is, two of like architecture
are never placed side by side. The company has a large number of these
houses occupied by operators and overseers. The cuts show the front and
side elevations, and the plans of the two floors. These are given as a

<p>Mr. A. Lindsay Miller, in the <i>Building News</i>, recommends for theaters
and other public buildings the use of gangways instead of stairs.</p>

<p>In public works, especially dye works, they will not use the stairs,
but gain access to the several floors by gangways, with a rise of about
5 ft. in 12 ft. or 13 ft. of length, and any one watching the speed
and ease with which the workers run from floor to floor would at once
understand why staircases are not used. Of course, architecturally,
they have not the dignity of the staircase; but, in theaters and music
halls, dignity is secondary to security. The advantage of the gangway
is easily explained.</p>

<p>In going down a stair, each step, or, in a hurry, each second step,
must be taken, and the slightest mistake throws the person down. In a
stair 12 ft. long, at least six different steps require to be taken.
In the gangway of the same length, a person in a hurry, or in the
excitement of a panic, would take it in two bounds, and with perfect
safety.</p>

<h3 id="ROBURITE_A_NEW_EXPLOSIVE">ROBURITE&mdash;A NEW EXPLOSIVE.</h3>

<p>A number of experiments were conducted lately at the works of Messrs.
Heenan &amp; Froude, Manchester, with a new explosive, called &#8220;roburite,&#8221;
which is manufactured in Germany, and is about to be introduced into
this country for use in blasting operations. The composition and
process of manufacture of this explosive are kept secret, but we
understand that it consists of two non&#8208;explosive and perfectly harmless
substances, of such a nature that they may be stored or transported
without special precautions or restrictions. These two substances may
be mixed together when required, and, in combination, become roburite,
a yellowish compound, which will bear rough handling with safety. We
understand that an intense heat is necessary to explode it. In order to
prove this, the explosive was placed, in the experiments in question,
between two plates, which were freely rubbed together and hammered;
and a small quantity thrown upon a fire was merely consumed, without
exploding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus017b.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p></div>

<p>In order to obtain an idea of the explosive effectiveness of roburite,
eight ounces of the explosive were placed on a plate of the very best
steel, at the point marked A in Fig. 1, which shows the state of the
plate after the explosion. This plate was 3 ft. square by ½ in.
thick, and a bulge of about 1 ft. diam. and 3½ in. deep was caused
by the explosion. Twelve ounces of the explosive were then placed at
A &#40;Fig. 2&#41; on a cast iron plate, 6 in. thick, and weighing nearly
three tons. After the explosion the plate was found to be broken
transversely, in the manner shown in the engraving. Unlike dynamite,
roburite is said to be in no way affected by varying temperatures,
and if duly protected against damp, it may be kept for years in any
climate, without its efficiency becoming in any way impaired. It is
also claimed by the manufacturers that roburite has an explosive force
greater than dynamite by at least 25 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus017c.jpg" width="500" height="241" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p></div>

<p>In exploding, roburite does not produce noxious gases, and, therefore,
may be used without intermission, while the poisonous gases given off
by dynamite often necessitate the stoppage of work, in some cases
for a considerable time. This new explosive is applicable for use
in mines and quarries, and for torpedoes and blasting operations
generally.&mdash;<i>Industries</i>.</p>

<p>Speaking of the large apartment house in New York lately condemned for
dry rot &#40;see illustration last November number of this paper&#41;, the
<i>American Architect</i> says: A few of the floors were of spruce, and
these, as might be expected, had resisted the rot much better than the
hemlock, and were still sound, but the construction ought certainly
to be changed. In view of the dangers from this source which attend
efforts to provide fire&#8208;resisting floors of wood, it would seem that
something might be done with light shapes of rolled iron beams. We have
seen rolled floor beams used in Paris nearly as light as wooden ones
of the same depth, and a tier of these, deafened with mortar on wire
in the French manner, and wire&#8208;lathed underneath, with a wooden floor
over, would cost little more than a solid mass of wooden beams, and
would be proof against rot as well as fire.</p>

<h3 id="The_Back_Yard"><span class="small">The Back Yard.</span></h3>

<p>Our immediate ancestors had their farm house, with its necessary
accompaniment of granaries, barn, etc. We move to town and build our
shingle palace or brick mansion, with its large front show window, in
which the well preserved, gilt edged family Bible and the Rogers group
have it which and t&#8217;other for supremacy&mdash;and set up in our back yard,
to represent the outbuildings of our ancestry, a privy, a pile of
slabwood, generally as dumped, a few barrels, perhaps a cheap stable.
Not then satisfied with the amount of decaying wood about the premises,
we lay a lot of wood walk.</p>

<p>Walking along the avenue, we see a pretentious residence. It must be
occupied by people of great refinement, for is not the most prominent
room in the house the library, the whole street side taken up with
an immense bay window, the glass reaching nearly to the floor? How
splendidly it was lighted as we passed last night! What elegant sets
of books on the shelves! Plenty of pictures, too. Let us to&#8208;day take
a look at the back yard. Why do not these people board up the windows
at the back of the house? Here is a well with a dirty puddle by it,
the pump standing on a rotting platform; hard by some kitchen garbage,
farther on ashes, and so it goes, the whole rear of the lot so bad as
to discourage vegetable life even. It is mercifully screened in part
from the general view by a high, unpainted board fence, against which,
now and then, a weed or tuft of grass grows. Where is there better
field for the crusade?</p>

<p>The rear of the house and the outbuildings, though not so expensively
finished, have a right to be carefully and artistically done. A
woodshed is not a nuisance if inclosed, well boarded and painted, and
the wood kept inside. A privy has no right to exist. If there be no
proper system of drainage in the house for a water closet, partition
off an earth closet from the woodshed or stable. Tasteful, well cared
for outbuildings and fences are not only not an offense to the artistic
sense, but are rather pleasing, indicating thrift, tidiness, and
comfort. But when we consider the opportunities they offer for the
support of the vine morning glories, sweet peas, nasturtiums, climbing
roses, and like forms of plant life, what a joyous recompense for so
little labor and care. Then all the available back yard space that is
not used for walks, drives, etc., should give either vegetables or
flowers&mdash;minister to the comfort or culture of the family.</p>

<p>Listen to people who lament the bad influences of street associations
upon the children. Yet they say, very reasonably, the children must
have outdoor air, etc., and they have never considered but that the
only alternative from the housing of the children is the freedom of
the streets. They do not know what moral education is contained in a
few feet of ground, congenial work for the hands, and the prettiest of
life development studies for the mind. Give each of these street&#8208;loving
children a flower bed, a small set of garden tools, some flower seeds,
and what help and advice they need, and note if there be not germs
of nobler thoughts and desires taking root at the same time in their
fertile natures. But&mdash;to moralize a little&mdash;there is a kinship between
the ornamented front and disgraceful rear of a residence and the
fine clothes and the false heart of the wearer, and we fear that the
majority of people who inhabit that sort of residence would rather risk
some contamination of their children&#8217;s characters than to see their
faces, hands, and clothes besmeared with Mother Earth.</p>

<p>The back yard of the future will be a bower of flowers and greenery and
the leisure hour resort of the family.&mdash;<i>N. W. Architect</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Thomas_Ustick_Walter"><span class="small">Thomas Ustick Walter.</span></h3>

<p>Thomas Ustick Walter died at his home, in Philadelphia, on October 30,
aged eighty&#8208;four years. He had been for some years president of the
American Institute of Architects.</p>

<p>His first principal work was the new county prison, in 1831, now
generally known as &#8220;Moyamensing Jail.&#8221; In 1833 he made the original
designs for Girard College, and was sent to Europe by the building
committee of the institution. His tour through the principal countries
was made for the specific purpose of the study of the principal
buildings of the old world. Upon his return he took charge of the
college buildings, which were finished in 1847, in accordance with his
suggestions, when he was also made one of the directors of the college.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter&#8217;s next great public work was the break&#8208;water at Laguayra
for the Venezuelan government. In 1851 his design for the extension
of the national capitol was adopted, and he was appointed government
architect. He removed to Washington, where he designed several
prominent public buildings, among them being the wing added to the
Patent Office in 1851, the reconstruction of the Congressional Library
building, which was destroyed by fire in 1851, the extensions of
the United States Treasury building in 1855, and the Post Office in
the same year, the dome of the national capitol, and the government
hospital for the insane.</p>

<h3 id="Pine_Woods"><span class="small">Pine Woods.</span></h3>

<p>The sights and sounds of pine woods, the comfort and delight of walking
in them, cannot be half told in a short paragraph. They are also as
sanitary as they are pleasing and beautiful. It is said that the air
of the Black Forest does more to revive and cure weakly patients than
gallons of medicine; and from experience of the odors of pines at
night, or in the early morning and dewy eve, I should say they were not
only antiseptic, but strengthening as a dose of quinine. The living
leaves, as well as the dead and slowly decomposing needles, redolent of
healing and strengthening odors, bring back the color to pale cheeks
and strength to semi&#8208;exhausted constitutions.</p>

<p>The shelter of pine forests is also perfect. No matter how the wind
thunders and roars among the tops, calm prevails on the surface of
the ground. Just as the waves of the ocean are, after all, limited to
its surface while a perpetual calm rests on its deeper depths, so the
turmoil of the storm exhausts its force on the tops of the trees, while
the base of the boles are hardly moved by it. Hence the superlative
value of pines in masses for shelter. The shelter of a large pine
wood is unique in character, providing a local atmosphere as genial
as it is pleasant. The elasticity of the dead needles seems to get
into one&#8217;s spirits, and enables one for the nonce to bid adieu to the
cares and the ills of life. One saunters along under the shadow of
tall pines without fatigue, and can rest on the clean, sweet carpet of
dead needles and leaves with little fear of noxious weeds, insects,
or malaria; and the whole air is deodorized and charged to the full
with health&#8208;giving properties by the odor&#8208;distributing pines, that not
only provide warmth and shelter, but health, to all who walk under
or linger among them. Pine woods in England are mostly too small to
furnish to the full all these advantages; but the black forests of
Scotland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia are massive enough to
furnish shelter, shadow, rest, and health to those wise enough to seek
for either amid their grand trunks or under their dense, dark masses of
branches and leaves.&mdash;<i>The Garden</i>.</p>

<h3 id="How_We_Have_Grown"><span class="small">How We Have Grown.</span></h3>

<p>When the history of the past seven years comes to be written, they
will stand as years of the most marvelous expansion ever known in our
history. Two of them, 1884 and 1885, were held as they passed to be
dull years, but even these included great growth, and were a period
of industrial readjustment rather than liquidation. The population of
this country has not increased more than a fourth since the census
of 1880, but house building, as an industry, has more than doubled,
the number of common brick made in this country having increased from
3,800,000,000 to 7,000,000,000, worth &#36;49,000,000. As the lumber trade
has increased in less but large proportion, and iron production has
risen over one&#8208;half from 4,300,000 tons in 1880 to 6,300,000 in 1886,
it is certain that the past seven years have seen the most active
building ever known in this country. Chicago uses one&#8208;seventeenth of
the brick made in the country, and if its building represents the same
share of the cost of house erection of all sorts in the United States,
fully &#36;2,000,000,000 have been spent on buildings in this country in
the last seven years. As about the same sum will be reached by adding
the building in the leading cities and estimating for the rest of the
country, the truth is probably not far from these figures, which are
under rather than over the mark. The railroad building since 1880 has
cost, at &#36;50,000 a mile, &#36;2,700,000,000. This makes &#36;4,700,000,000, or
about one&#8208;tenth of the national wealth in 1880, turned into railroads
and buildings in this country. As the residence and business real
estate of the country, including water power, was valued in the census
of 1880 at &#36;9,881,000,000, and the railroads at &#36;5,500,000,000, we
have added one&#8208;half to the cost of the latter and one&#8208;fifth to the
former in seven years, although the railroads represent the accumulated
construction of fifty years, and the buildings are spread over an even
longer period in their erection. This enormous increase has taken place
without adding a bale to the cotton to be carried or a bushel to the
grain raised. No more pork is produced now than in 1880, and the number
of sheep is no greater now than then. Great increase has been made
in cattle raised for food, in fruits, and, on the average, in canned
goods. Coal, taking bituminous and anthracite together, has increased
one&#8208;half from 70,000,000 to 106,000,000 tons. Copper has advanced in
output from 27,009 tons in 1880 to 69,800 in 1886, and about the same
this year. A great advance is true of nearly all mineral products, but
in agriculture the United States has made little or no progress in
product in the last seven years, but a great advance in acreage or the
cost of cultivation.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>Charles Hardy, in the <i>National Builder</i>, says: Underestimating means

impoverishment and poor work. The contractor has himself and his family
to maintain, and the temptation is great to get out by doing poor work.
I would suggest that every contractor purchase an account book large

estimate&mdash;giving quantity, price, and labor for each item. Let him
leave opposite to this page a blank page, on which he may enter, on the

<h3 id="THE_JOHN_CROUSE_MEMORIAL_COLLEGE_FOR_WOMEN">THE JOHN CROUSE MEMORIAL COLLEGE FOR WOMEN.</h3>

<p>We take pleasure in presenting to our readers an illustration of
the John Crouse Memorial College for Women, which it is proposed to
erect on the hill west of the Hall of Languages, Syracuse University,
Syracuse, N. Y. This edifice is to be the gift of one of the wealthiest
and most prominent citizens of Syracuse, Mr. John Crouse. The donor of
this magnificent gift well deserves to be held in grateful remembrance
by every friend and well wisher of the Syracuse University, as well
as by the students and faculty. It is proposed to make this building
a model one in every respect, and neither pains nor money are to be
spared to render it the most perfectly equipped college to be found in
the country. The structure is to be five stories in height, to be built
of East Long Meadow brownstone, and to cover an area of nearly two
hundred feet square.</p>

<p>In this connection a brief historical sketch of Syracuse University may
interest our readers.</p>

<p>The college now known as Syracuse University had its origin in Lima,
a pretty little village in Western New York, but quite out of the
way, and not easy of access. It was then called Genesee College,
and the first gathering of faculty and students occurred on Monday,
June 9, 1851. The faculty consisted of Benjamin F. Tefft, D.D. LL.D.
and Professors Houghton, Douglass, Whitlock, and Alverson. On June
12 of same year, the Rev. B. F. Tefft was inaugurated president of
Genesee College, and on July 10 the names of thirty&#8208;eight students
were enrolled on the college register. November 5 saw the faculty
increased by the addition of Professors Hoyt and Fowler. The college
thus organized continued with varying fortunes until July 7, 1871, when
it disbanded. In 1866 the subject of removing the college from Lima
began to be agitated, and the idea of a central university for the
Methodism of New York was first publicly announced in the <i>Northern
Christian Advocate</i>, during the year 1873. From this time forth the
new enterprise met with great favor on all sides, except with the
citizens of Lima, who were reluctant to see the withdrawal from their
midst of their principal attraction, to which we may well believe they
had become greatly attached, and who procured an injunction against
its removal. Prominent members of the Methodist Central Conference
were nevertheless commissioned to carry forward the good work, and
substantial aid was soon forthcoming. Syracuse, being the most central
city in the State, was finally settled upon as the most appropriate
home for the new college.</p>

<p>The site now known as University Hill was secured, plans made by the
well known architect, H. N. White, were adopted, and July 19, 1871,
the contract for building the Hall of Languages was let for the sum
of &#36;136,000, and Syracuse University became an assured fact. The
corner stone of the Hall of Languages was laid on August 31, with
impressive ceremonies, and the faculty of the College of Liberal
Arts was inaugurated. On September 1 the college opened in the Myers
block, which had been secured for the use of the university, and here
the sessions were held until May 1, 1873, when the Hall of Languages
being completed, it was on that date occupied for the first time.
During the year 1871 the plan for a medical college in connection
with the university was adopted, and its first commencement exercises
were held February 12, 1873. When the Hall of Languages was erected,
other buildings were contemplated at such time as the finances of
the university should admit of their realization. The institution
has struggled along, sometimes meeting with reverses, but now and
then being fortified and strengthened by the reception of substantial
encouragement from some of its many and devoted friends. Now at last
the wheel of fortune has suddenly turned in its favor, and it finds
itself at the flood tide of prosperity, with the prospect before it of
a long and honorable course of usefulness and well deserved success.
University Hill commands a magnificent view of the belt of hills which
girdle the city, with Onondaga Lake set like a sparkling gem in the
distance. Upon the west hill an observatory has just been erected,
and near the Hall of Languages a suitable building is in process of
erection, for the accommodation of the fine and valuable library which
has been generously bestowed upon it by one of its friends. Syracusans
are proud of the University, and they, in common with its hosts of warm
friends throughout all parts of the country, rejoice in the evidence of
its well merited prosperity.</p>

<p>The alumni of Syracuse University have members not only in almost
every State in the Union, but count among their number graduates
from Canada, England, Mexico, San Domingo, Brazil, China, India, and
Japan.&mdash;<i>Architectural Era</i>.</p>

<h3 id="How_a_Marble_Statue_is_Made"><span class="small">How a Marble Statue is Made.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. John A. P. Macbride, sculptor, who was introduced to a large
audience, chiefly of workingmen, by Sir James Picton, recently gave a
practical lecture on the above subject, at the Rotunda lecture hall,
Liverpool. After giving a sketch of the art and its great antiquity,
the lecturer drew a profile in chalk on the blackboard, which he filled
in with clay, and proceeded to demonstrate the building up and modeling
of a portrait bust of soft clay. He stated that there was a general
and erroneous opinion that in taking a portrait bust it was necessary
to take a cast of the face. This was a mistake, for the head lost all
the spirit and go by such a mechanical process that should distinguish
an artist&#8217;s work. The truth was not always that which appeared to be
true, and the sculptor had to convey some idea of the character as well
as of the mind of the sitter; and a man who knew his work ought to be
able to do so with his fingers. Carving was a secondary consideration.
The lecturer then explained the process of pointing a marble statue.
In this process, the model and the block of marble were each fixed on
a base called a scale stone, to which a standard vertical rod could be
attached at corresponding centers, having at its upper end a sliding
needle, so adapted by a movable joint as to be set at any angle and
fastened by a screw when set. The sculptor having marked the governing
points with a pencil on the model, the instrument was applied to these,
and the measure taken. The standard being then transferred to the block
base, the pointer, guided by this measure, cuts away the marble, taking
care to leave it rather larger than the model, so that the general
proportions were kept, and the more important work then left for the
sculptor&#8217;s hand.&mdash;<i>Building News.</i></p>

<h3 id="A_Great_Building"><span class="small">A Great Building.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. J. L. Smithmeyer, architect of the Congressional Library building,
states in his first annual report that the Congressional Library
building when completed will be the largest structure in Washington,
with the exception of the Capitol. It will cover 111,000 square feet of
space.</p>

<p>In a building of such magnitude and importance, every step in the
progress of the work must be carefully considered, lest fatal mistakes,
due to hasty construction, should occur. It was deemed of the utmost
importance to test every foot of ground supporting the foundation
walls. For this purpose a traveling testing machine was constructed,
which will give an accurate test of the entire soil. The tests thus far
made have been most satisfactory, the soil standing a maximum pressure
of 13&middot;5 tons to the square foot, only 2&middot;5 tons being required. These
tests will be continued until the foundations are laid.</p>

<p>The method of testing the soil and putting in the concrete foundations
may be briefly described as follows: First, the trench excavations are
made by the contractor to the width and depth required by the plans,
the bottom of the trenches being made perfectly level. Then the testing
machine, consisting of a car bearing the required amount of weight in
pig lead for making the tests, is placed in the trenches upon iron
rails, which rest upon four cast iron pedestals, the latter being set
four feet apart each way, each pedestal covering one foot of ground.
Thus, one&#8208;fourth of the entire weight borne by the car rests upon
each one of the pedestals, and the precise weight sustained by each
square foot of ground is exactly determined. The soil being thus tested
as to its resisting strength, is then ready to receive the concrete
foundations.</p>

<h3 id="Proportions_of_Rooms"><span class="small">Proportions of Rooms.</span></h3>

<p>There are few objects connected with our art that have been more
frequently dwelt on by those who have undertaken to be our guides and
monitors than the right proportions to be given to rooms. Vitruvius
led the way, and subsequent theorizers have laid down, sometimes very
dogmatically, their views of just proportions. I find, however, in the
actual practice of the ablest men such extreme diversity, and I observe
pleasing effects producible by the adoption of such widely different
proportions, that I find myself, I confess, much inclined to be
somewhat incredulous of all these theories. Certainly if beauty could
be thus reduced to a formula, and the proper relation indisputably
established between the length, breadth, and height of every room,
a royal road would be cleared for us, which would be at least very
convenient both to those who teach and to those who learn. I fear I
can scarcely hope to furnish you with such a desirable help in your
studies. I find rooms of universally admitted beauty, yet of almost
every geometrical figure. I have heard of the room in the museum of
Florence, the Tribune it is called, which contains the Venus di Medici,
spoken of in terms of rapturous approval for the beauty of its form
and proportions. This saloon is an equilateral octagon on plan. I have
known square rooms greatly admired&mdash;such, for example, as the saloon in
Cobham Hall, which is usually pointed to as one of the <i>chefs&#8208;d&#8217;œuvre</i>
of Inigo Jones. Who is there that is not charmed with the proportions
of the Pantheon at Rome? This, you know, is circular. The classical
teacher of our art, Vitruvius, seems to contemplate only rectangular
forms, and directs us to adapt the double cube and the cube and a half,
whether for a temple or a triclinium.</p>

<p>The Sistine Chapel, attached to the Papal Palace, upon which the best
art of Italy in its best days was expended, is a triple cube, viz.,
133 by 44. While of modern French, Italian, and English teachers, each
seems to have his own special favorite proportion. The truth I believe
to be that, so bounteously have we been endowed, and so liberally have
the laws of beauty in form and proportion been framed, there exists
in fact an endless variety of beautiful forms and proportions. My
impression is that it is as little consistent with truth to lay down
any one definite form or proportion as the best as it is to extol any
one particular curve as the line of beauty. I believe that there are as
many pleasing proportions to be given to rooms as there are pleasing
harmonies of color and sound. The purpose of a room must always be an
important guide in determining the form and proportions to be given
to it. If planned so long in proportion to its width as to remind us
of a passage, it loses its distinctive character, and creates a false
impression, which it can never be good art to do. It is indeed obvious
that a consideration of the special fitness of a room for its destined
uses must always greatly influence its proportions. The octagon form,
so much affected by our ancestors in planning their chapter houses,
owes its origin probably far more to the propriety of that form for a
chamber intended for the convenient assemblage of the members of the
chapter sitting in council than to any intrinsic architectural beauty,
however unquestionable that beauty may be.&mdash;<i>S. Smirke.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Firemen&#8217;s Herald</i> says fire protection, like charity, should begin
at home. However efficient may be the public service against fire, a
single bucket of water properly administered may stop a fire that all
the efforts of the brigade would be unable to quench, and besides, the
jet of a powerful engine is as destructive in its way as fire to all
perishable articles within a room, such as furniture, pictures, and
bric&#8208;a&#8208;brac.</p>

<h3 id="Plants_for_Room_Decoration"><span class="small">Plants for Room Decoration.</span></h3>

<p>The universal custom now prevailing in most establishments of having a
few plants in addition to cut flowers dotted about the different rooms
induces me to write a short paper thereon, not only because it has
developed into a very important part of the gardener&#8217;s work, but it
likewise requires a fair share of taste in the arrangements, as well as
suitable plants for the purpose. Generally speaking, each room being
differently furnished will require a different class of plants for
its adornment, but, as a rule, plants with stiff, upright growth are
objectionable to the eye, as they do not hide the pot or stems unless
others of a dwarfer growth are associated with them; therefore they
should only be used when possessing special features either in flower
or foliage. Too many plants in a room are objectionable, because they
detract from rather than elevate or enhance the effect, especially if
the room is elaborately furnished. For instance, plants assigned to the
front hall or corridor would be unsuitable in a drawing room or boudoir.</p>

<p>Another important matter to study is the various kinds of receptacles
provided for the use of plants. These vary in size and shape greatly,
but are generally of a fanciful, elaborate, and artistic design, and
the plants for these should be selected with the greatest care and
taste, so as to add a completeness and finish, and in no way hide or
diminish the effect of their appearance. I have often found, however,
a great difficulty in getting plants to go in them without taking
them out of the pots, and in many cases I have found it necessary to
reduce the ball of roots in order to fit the latter in properly. This
quite ruins the plant, for, in the case of choice or delicate growing
subjects, it is almost impossible for them to recover. But in order to
meet this difficulty, it is advisable to make a selection of plants,
grow them in suitable sized pots, and use them for no other purpose.
To do this it requires a sufficient number for three changes; say, if
twenty plants are required at one time, sixty should be grown, and
duplicates of all to be grown to follow on.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of rooms is generally dry, though warm, and impregnated
with gas and other enemies to plant life. So different is all this to
the healthy atmosphere of a plant house, that it is necessary that
every plant used should have completed its growth, or some injury will
follow. Take the different varieties of adiantums, for instance. If
used for the decoration of rooms in a growing state, the young fronds
would most certainly be injured; yet, when properly prepared, there
are no more popular or suitable plants for the purpose, and they can
be grown to a useful size in small pots. Nephrolepis exaltata, though
not so choice as others, is a most handsome fern to use. Its long and
gracefully drooping fronds are an ornament in any position, while many
of the Pteris family have a fine and graceful appearance, and may be
used freely. Nice plants of Spiræa japonica with or without flowers are
very ornamental. The different sorts of lycopods make perfect plants
for small vases, as also do the artillery plant &#40;Pilea muscosa&#41; and
the little Caladium argyrites. In fact, there is no lack of either
foliage or flowering plants suitable for a tasteful arrangement either
in a drawing room or boudoir, while for more commodious places, such
as the entrance hall, corridor, or staircase, and where larger plants
are admissible, there is the beautiful Caladium esculentum, with noble
foliage and which stands well, several sorts of palms, the larger
fronded ferns, curculigo, Ficus elastica, Hibbertia volubilis, and the
calla or Ethiopian lily, all of which have a reputation for retaining
their beauty better than many others, and therefore should be grown
for the purpose. But to avoid as little injury as possible, frequent
changes are necessary, and it is a very good rule to water every
plant well before it is used, and when it again needs water change it
for another. Let all pots and plants be kept very clean, and avoid
letting the plants remain long enough to make growth in the different
positions, for such growth, when brought out to the light, is generally
very weak.&mdash;<i>Thomas Record, The Garden.</i></p>

<p class="chapter center noindent"><b>THE WAINWRIGHT HORIZONTAL FEED&#8208;WATER HEATER.</b></p>

<p>We illustrate herewith the Wainwright Horizontal Feed&#8208;Water Heater,
adapted for use in a horizontal position under the floor of an engine
room, or where the head room is limited. The feed water enters at the
lower opening marked &#8220;feed,&#8221; fills the body of the heater, and having
been heated by the exhaust steam surrounding the tubes, passes to the
boiler at upper opening marked &#8220;feed,&#8221; the exhaust entering at either
end. A drip pipe, as shown, is provided for escape of the water of
condensation, and a hand hole for washing and cleaning. It will be
seen that this heater contains a large body of water well disposed to
receive heat, the tubes, being of corrugated copper, present 50 per
cent. increased heating surface over plain tubes of the same length,
while at the same time five times the strength is added, and owing to
their property of expansion and contraction, all danger of the ends
pulling out or the joints working and leaking is eliminated. This
property of expansion and contraction also prevents any accumulation of
scale and sediment.</p>

<p>This gas engine, manufactured by the Williams &amp; Orton Manufacturing
Company, of Sterling, Illinois, possesses various features that must
commend it to the attention of all interested in the production of
power from gas. It is characterized by great simplicity, having no
gearing, so that it is practically noiseless. It has a power and a
supply cylinder, one placed over the other, and each working or worked
by its own crank. An impulse is given at every revolution of the wheel,
and by the governing device the amount of gas consumed is regulated in
proportion to the work done. The ignition valve is easily accessible,
and needs no adjustment on starting the engine. It can be used either
for gas or gasoline. For the latter, a few drops are aspirated at each
stroke into the cylinder, where mingling with the air they form the
mixture for ignition. The gasoline can be kept in a tank outside the
building, and is subjected to no contact with the flame until it has
been thoroughly vaporized and has entered the working cylinder.</p>

<p>A four&#8208;roll machine that is simple and durable, and all geared with
the most improved extension gearing, is shown in the accompanying
illustration, as made by Messrs. E. &amp; F. Gleason, manufacturers
of improved wood tools, American Street and Susquehanna Avenue,
Philadelphia, Pa. Both heads are driven with one counter, and only two
belts are required, the adjustment of bed and control of feed being
both on left&#8208;hand side of machine, at B C, within immediate reach
of the operator. The bottom head is quite as easy of adjustment as
the top head, having large screws, F, one at each box, to regulate
cut or chip and keep it in line with bed and top head, both heads
having self&#8208;oiling boxes. The machine will double&#8208;surface stuff from
one&#8208;eighth inch to six inches in thickness. It occupies a floor space
of about four feet by forty inches. The counter shaft has patent

<h3 id="Foundations_in_Wet_Ground"><span class="small">Foundations in Wet Ground.</span></h3>

<p>A new method of making foundations in wet ground has been devised by M.
Bonnetond, a French military engineer. His plan is to bore a hole 10
ft. or 12 ft. deep and 1½ ft. in diameter in the damp ground, and in
this a series of dynamite cartridges are placed, and finally exploded.
The expansion of the gases generated drives the water far out beyond
the sides of the hole, into which it does not return for at least
half an hour. The time thus gained is utilized in rapidly excavating
the cavity, which is then filled with a cement concrete, which sets
before the return of the water. The method has been adopted in the
construction of a fortified enceinte at Lyons, and is said to have led
to very rapid work.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_TO_MAKE_A_CHEERFUL_FIRESIDE">HOW TO MAKE A CHEERFUL FIRESIDE.</h3>

<p>In the accompanying illustration is shown one of several forms of
arranging artificial sticks or logs in a fireplace for burning gas,
to give a close imitation of a blazing wood fire, which has been
patented and is made by Henry P. Dixon &amp; Co, of 1330 Chestnut Street,
Philadelphia. Several other forms of logs and grouping are also made,
the sticks and the logs being colored to resemble wood, and having
fixed between them splints of asbestos, which become incandescent when
in use, so that when the gas is turned on and a match applied to the
small jets arranged to the best advantage over and between the logs, it
gives the appearance of a first class wood fire. These artificial logs
are made of material not injured by the flames, and are designed to
last a life&#8208;time without cracking or breaking, the gas being supplied
through a brass union fixed in the back of each log, through which
connection can be readily made by rubber tubing or otherwise to the
nearest gas pipe. A good, cheerful fire, which makes neither dust,
dirt, nor ashes, is thus ever ready at hand and available by simply
turning on and lighting the gas, the flow of which is regulated as
desired.</p>

<h3 id="The_Sounding_Board_in_St_Paul8217s_Cathedral"><span class="small">The Sounding Board in St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral.</span></h3>

<p>The form of the sounding board is, I think, a novelty, but I am led
to believe that it is an approach to the true form for the purpose.
Flat sounding boards have been most commonly tried, but they are now
generally discarded. A parabolic sounding board behind the preacher
has been used with a certain effect, but the advantage is limited to
those in the direction of the axis of the curve; and in these cases,
action and reaction being equal, the preacher can sometimes hear the
criticisms of his audience, if any should be uttered tolerably loud
in the proper direction. Besides which, a shell of this description
would have had little effect in stopping the objectionable echoes. To
meet these difficulties, a curve was selected which has the property
of distributing uniformly in every direction so much of the preacher&#8217;s
voice as can be advantageously reflected. The figure is hyperbolic,
the axis being perpendicular over the preacher. The diameter is ten
feet, and so much of the voice it receives is reflected as if it came
from a point about four feet from the preacher. It would be interesting
to know, but I am not aware that sufficient experiments have been
made to ascertain, what amount of sound is reflected from a given
material. The harder the material, obviously the better the result.
In this case hard organ pipe metal has been used. I observed a marked
increase of audibility of the voice at a place where the assistance
of the reflected sound is obtained over a point equidistant from the
pulpit, but too high to receive the reflected wave from the sounding
board.&mdash;<i>F. C. Penrose.</i></p>

<p>A strong and well made band saw machine, to be run by foot or hand

by Messrs. J. M. Marston &amp; Co., of No. 3 Appleton Street, Boston, Mass.
The table is 18 × 21 inches and 42 inches high, and is adjustable for
cutting on a bevel. There is an adjustable guide for the saw above and
below the table, the saw pulleys are 16 inches in diameter, and the
driving power is by means of gears, all shafts being of steel. The
upper saw pulley has an adjustment to tighten the saw and bring it in
line with the lower saw pulley. The power machines are from the same
pattern, and are arranged with driving shaft and pulley on lower part
of the frame, and tight and loose pulley on lower saw shaft, so that
it can be belted direct from main shafting without counter shaft. The
machine is a very easy&#8208;working one, cutting some four times as fast as
a gig saw with less power.</p>

iron, with grooves planed for gauges to slide in, which allows very
fine and exact work to be done on the machine. There is a collar on
the arbor, so that any endwise wear can be taken up, and the gears are
accurately cut from solid iron. The aim of the manufacturers has been
to make a simple, strong, accurate, and durable machine, such as can be
put to hard work without injury, some of their saws having been in use
for fifteen years without needing repairs.</p>

<p>It sends the heat where wanted. It protects the woodwork near from
fire. It is a great saving in fuel. It prevents water and gas pipes
from freezing. It prevents the condensation of steam. Fire and
water have no effect on them. <i>They do not powder down, char, nor
crack.</i> They are cleanly in application. They are neat and regular

<p>This is a Cast Iron Casing, lined with tin or galvanized iron, to
prevent direct radiation of heat in cellar; four loose panels lift out,
so as to give access to furnace for repairs or renewal, if necessary,
without disturbing the Hot Air Pipes; it has sliding panels for feed
door and smoke pipe to allow for expansion; it has also a dust flue and
flue door for Damper. We claim this to be the most complete, durable,
and convenient cold case made, equal in efficiency to Brick set, with
much less room required and less expensive, besides the facility for
access for repairs, without requiring, as in a brick set, so large
a space to work in. It is much superior to the ordinary sheet iron
casing, both for durability and efficiency. It is not necessary to
remove the casing or Hot Air Pipe to clean out, or repair, or even
renew or change the heater.</p>

portion of their ripping in preference to carting their lumber to a
mill five minute&#8217;s drive from their shops. The same is true in regard
to scroll sawing, mortising, tenoning, cutting stuff for drawers,

<p>&#40;1&#41; G. W. B. asks: 1. What kind of cement used, and how to cement gum
face on band saws? A. Ordinary rubber cement, such as you can purchase
at any of the rubber stores, will answer your purpose. 2. Is there
anything to be put in glue to prevent moisture from disturbing the
joints in patterns? A. A little bichromate of potash put into your glue
will render it insoluble, after exposure to light. 3. Is there anything
to prevent shellac used for patterns from getting dark before using
after it is mixed some time? A. We know of no way to prevent this.</p></div>

<div class="advert">
<p>&#40;2&#41; W. S. C.&mdash;In closed circuits for steam heating, the pressure of the
steam along the flow pipes and in coils in well arranged systems is so
nearly equalized with the pressure in the boiler, that it requires but
small elevation of the water of condensation in the return pipe above
the water level in the boiler to allow of its return by gravity. In
this system all of the radiators should be not less than from 1 to 5
feet above the water level in the boiler, according to the complication
and extent of the circuit. The air is discharged at the radiators, and
no waste of water is necessary.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;3&#41; E. H. S.&mdash;Coal tar alone with gravel and sand for sidewalks does not
dry well. Asphaltum with equal parts of coal tar melted together and
sprinkled upon the mixed sand and gravel that has been made hot upon
an iron plate &#40;the mixing to be done in a large pan of iron&#41;, putting
no more asphalt and tar upon the sand and gravel than will just make
it stick together; then dump into place while hot, spread quickly, and
beat level with a ram or heavy roller. Dust over the surface with fine
sand before rolling or beating, to prevent the material from sticking
to the roller or beater. This operation requires a little care and
experience as to just the amount of asphalt and tar for a given measure
of sand and gravel, and also for the proportions of sand and gravel
required to make the best pavement. Sometimes a thin bed of broken
stone is laid as a foundation. Also a thin bed of coarse gravel is
sometimes spread before dumping the hot mixture.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;4&#41; J. C.&mdash;A first class ice boat, sailing on first class ice, will sail
from three to four times faster than the wind that drives the boat. For
example, a wind having a velocity of fifteen miles an hour will drive
the boat at the rate of from forty to sixty miles an hour.</p></div>

<p>Each wheel on the <b>&#8220;Barry Hanger&#8221;</b> is on an independent axle. All
other hangers have the two wheels on <b>one axle</b>. Consequently,
when one track settles more than the other &#40;as they frequently do&#41;,
the <b>axle &#8220;tips,&#8221;</b> and carries the door <b>side&#8208;wise</b> toward
the lowest track, causing an unpleasant rubbing against the track or
casings below. The <b>&#8220;Barry Hanger&#8221;</b> overcomes this trouble, and
a door will run as <b>easy</b> and <b>true</b> in the <b>center</b>,
when there is a variation of one half inch or more in the height of the
tracks, as it would when they are perfectly level.</p>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;7&#41; C. W. C. desires &#40;1&#41; a recipe for a stain to imitate mahogany on
white birch wood, that will not raise the grain of the wood. A. A dark
mahogany stain is made as follows: Boil half a pound of madder and 2
ounces of logwood chips in 1 gallon of water, and brush well over the
wood while hot; when dry, go over the whole with pearlash solution,
2 drachms to the quart. 2. Can you give recipe for making the acid
stain? A. In the acid stain you take nitric acid, and dilute with 10
parts of water, and wash the wood with it. 3. Are there any books which
give full directions for imitating the different woods? A. We would
recommend for your purpose Spons&#8217; Workshop Receipts &#40;second series&#41;,
which we can send you, postpaid, for &#36;2.00.</p></div>

varnishing carved wood. A. Take 1 ounce copal and ½ ounce shellac;
powder them well, and put them into a bottle or jar containing 1 quart
alcohol. Place the mixture in a warm place and shake it occasionally
until the gums are completely dissolved; and when strained the varnish
will be ready for use.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;9&#41; J. W. B. desires a recipe for some fire&#8208;extinguishing liquid.
A. One of the best solutions for the extinction of incipient fires
consists of crude calcium chloride 20 parts, salt 5 parts, dissolved in
water 75 parts. Keep at hand, and apply with a hand pump.</p></div>

and have put in a lathe, boiler, and engine of a total weight of
2,400 pounds, resting upon 3 joists 3 inches by 9 inches by 16 feet 0
inches. Will it strengthen the floor sufficiently to enable it to carry
the increased weight if I bolt three 3 inch by 8 inch joists to the
existing ones? A. You had better use 4 inch by 8 inch joists bolted

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;11&#41; W. A. writes: I have noticed in your issue of the <span class="smcap">Scientific
American</span>, at various times, the receipt for making a printing
machine called the hektograph. You also gave a recipe for making a
black ink to be used with the same. I have tried both, but I find
a great difficulty in gaining a success. I have tried the process
for the ink in the manner you describe, but I fail to produce any
copies. Ink is prepared with nigrosine. It will not create a bronze.
Would you therefore kindly direct me in the right direction, that is
to say, to get a black ink that can be used by the hektograph? A.
The ink you desire is made by dissolving soluble nigrosine &#40;aniline
black&#41; in 5 to 7 parts of water. It should be a saturated solution and
rather thick. For use on the hektograph it is best to use a purple
ink. See &#8220;The Copying Pad,&#8221; etc., contained in <span class="smcap">Scientific American

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;12&#41; A. C. R. writes: Can you recommend me a good rubber cement? I wish
to cement leather together, the cement to be waterproof, to resist oil,
and the leather to retain its elasticity after pressing. A. Dissolve
gutta percha in bisulphide of carbon; shave off the edges of the
leather, and pour on the cement; allow to evaporate to dryness. Then
put the two faces together, previously heating thoroughly, and press
until cool.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;13&#41; G. F. asks the best kind of a vessel to make liquid gold in, for

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;14&#41; W. J. M. asks how papier mache is made to stand the action of
water. A. Coat with a mixture made by fusing together equal parts
of pitch and gutta percha, to which is added two parts of linseed
oil containing five parts of litharge. Continue the heat until the
ingredients are uniformly commingled, and apply warm.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;15&#41; J. D. &amp; Co. ask a process to prevent the smuts from escaping in
the air from a lampblack house. A. Carry the outlet of your lampblack
chamber to one side and into the top of a vertical shaft, where place a
rose jet of water. Have the water drop vertically in an even spray, so
as to produce a draught down the shaft. The water will gather the waste
lampblack, which can be either utilized or run into the sewer. A vent
at the bottom of the shaft may connect with a chimney or into the open
air. A pump or city water supply will be required.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;16&#41; W. D. G., Jr., asks how large a main pipe will be required to
supply 6 hydrants and 50 dwelling houses, the water to be brought 1
mile with a 70&#8242; head; the hydrants to be used with a 1&#8243; nozzle, and
there being no probability of more than two being required at a time?
A. About a 6&#8243; pipe; a smaller one would not give the desired pressure
for hydrant uses.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;17&#41; S. M. writes: Can you give a formula for a brilliant waterproof
finishing polish to be used on veneer after it is rubbed down with
pumice stone and water? The polish to be applied the same as French
polish. Use linseed oil 1½ pounds, amber 1 pound, litharge 5 ounces,
white lead, pulverized, 5 ounces, minium 5 ounces. Boil the linseed
oil in an untinned copper vessel, and suspend in it the litharge and
minium in a small bag, which must touch the bottom of the vessel.
Continue the boiling until the oil has acquired a deep brown color,
then take out of the bag and put in a clove of garlic; this is to be
repeated 7 or 8 times, the boiling being always continued. Before the
amber is added to the oil it is to be mixed with 2 ounces linseed oil
and melted over a fire that is well kept up. When the mass is fluid, it
is to be boiled and stirred continually for 2 or 3 minutes; afterward
filter the mixture, and preserve it in bottles tightly corked. When
this varnish is used, the wood must be previously well polished and
covered with a thin coat of soot and spirits of turpentine. When the
coat is dry some of the varnish may be applied, which should be equally
distributed on every part with a small, fine sponge. This operation
must be repeated four times, being always careful that each coat will
be well dried first. After the last coat of varnish, the wood must be
dried in an oven and afterward polished.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;18&#41; G. P. writes: We want some plan to prevent the noise or work of
our lodge room &#40;I.O.O.F.&#41; from being heard in the room below; we have a
good floor and carpet, good partitions, walls plastered, etc., but are
willing to go to quite an expense to remedy the present defect on this
score. A. Probably you have no deafening under the floor. In such case
there are only two ways that we can suggest for your trouble: To take
up the floor and put in a plaster deafening between the seams. Next,
to take up the carpet and lay two thicknesses of roof felting or paper
boards &#40;book&#8208;binders&#8217; boards might do, or paper carpet lining&#41;. Then
lay battens across the floor, and a new floor on the battens. Do not
nail the battens to the old floor. Then lay the carpet lining and the
carpet on the lining.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;19&#41; W. A.&mdash;To clean marble from discoloration: Try 2 parts sodium
carbonate, 1 of pumice stone, and 1 of finely powdered chalk. Mix into
a fine paste with water. Rub this over the marble, and the stains will
be removed; then wash with soap and water.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;20&#41; F. B. asks in regard to papier mache floor covering: 1. Will it
hurt to use printed paper? A. According to the article &#8220;A Papier Mache
Floor Covering&#8221; we find Manila paper recommended. It is very likely
that newspaper would answer, but it is by no means as strong an article
as the variety spoken of. 2. How thick will that covering be? A. The
thickness depends upon whether more than a single thickness of the
paper is used&mdash;probably from one&#8208;sixteenth to one&#8208;eighth of an inch in
thickness. 3. How long will it be before it is ready for use? A. That
depends entirely upon the drying; if artificial heat is applied, we
should think that the whole operation could be carried through and the
covering finished within a week.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;21&#41; C. C. C. asks: Which would be the best test for water works&mdash;to
have three streams on one main near each other, or three streams on
different mains scattered over the town? The mains 8 inches, 6 inches,
and 4 inches, works half a mile from town. A. If you are testing in the
interest of contractors, place the trial streams as near the source of
supply as possible, and also near the 8 inch main. A fair test will be
to locate the streams widely apart on one distributing branch.</p></div>

<div class="advert"><p>&#40;22&#41; F. L. asks how to imitate walnut graining. A. Try the following:
The wood, previously thoroughly dried and warmed, is coated once or
twice with a stain composed of 1 ounce extract of walnut peel dissolved
in 6 ounces of soft water by heating it to boiling, and stirring. The
wood, thus treated, when half dry is brushed with a solution of 1 ounce
potassium bichromate in 5 ounces boiling water, and is then allowed to
dry thoroughly, and is to be rubbed and polished as usual.</p></div>

Mr. <span class="smcap">E. N. Gates</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap add1em">Dear Sir</span>: Having now used your system of Hot Water Circulation
in my house from December first to May fifth, it gives me pleasure
to say that it has met the requirements of the extreme cold of the
past winter and the mild weather of the spring months in the most
perfect manner, giving out just the temperature for comfort in all the
variations of temperature outside, and with great economy in fuel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours respectfully,<br />
<span class="right">H. F. COGGSHALL, <i>Treasurer and Manager</i>.</span></p></div>

<p><b>The following Special Advantages over other Methods of Heating</b>:</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Over Hot Air Furnaces</span>.&mdash;No Dust! No Burnt Air! No Gas!
and ability to send the heat where it is wanted, without regard to
direction of wind or height of cellar, and using less fuel for amount
of space heated.</p>

<p>2d.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Over Steam, High or Low Pressure</span>.&mdash;From the fact the
temperature of water in radiators can be between 70° and 212° or
higher, thus adapting it to all degrees of outside temperature,
thereby, taking the season through, it makes a great saving in fuel
in this point alone, besides the comfort of having a building evenly
heated.</p>

<p>3d.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Over Other Hot Water Systems</span>.&mdash;In all others, the water
goes to Radiators from one common reservoir. Therefore, being next
to impossible to have all rooms heated alike. Different rooms will
receive current of water at different rates of speed. With this system
all rooms can be heated alike, when desired, from the fact that each
current is provided with an independent boiler, and the hot water must
go where the pipe leads, and you have perfect control over every room,
and can be put in at less cost than any other system of hot water
heating to do the same work.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
